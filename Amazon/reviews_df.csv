"Great if you know what to expect. If your expectations are realistic for this reasonably priced item you will be happy. $70 (+$0.50/photo paper sheet) is in my book reasonable for a camera/printer in one considering that there is never a need to purchase toner and there is the option for a Mini SD/ability to save digitally. I think the manufacturer photos/videos are realistic they make no claims to great photo quality - the best thing about this camera is the fun instant factor. The photo quality will seem subpar in comparison to the excellent cameras we are all used to now on our smartphones but in good lighting (esp outdoors) the color/picture is good. Do not expect super sharp details or super vibrant colors. Great fun for parties photo booth option with instant gratification (photos are immediately dry pretty darn water resistant and sticky backed for collage fun). Minus 1 star because it is shutter button is SO easy to hit at $0.50 a pop it gets annoying (every picture taken prints no choice) really should have a lock or require firmer pushing. Defined area in viewfinder is a bit hard to see.Camera does beep when turned on and ready and when shutter has been pressed. Kodak does provide a manual online no manual included worth a quick perusal for details like \x91don\x92t add more paper until empty \x91camera holds up to 3 images?(as in it will retain 3 photos if you\x92re out of paper and you have not inserted microSD). " 
 "Not great. Ok so the design of this camera is super cute.! I mostly use an instax Fujifilm camera for my photos but it's really bulky to tote around. The box my Kodak arrived in notes that the camera has 10 mp and came with a trial pack of film. I was however a bit disappointed with the quality of the picture. To me it was sorta like if you took a pic with an old flip phone and printed it. Also when you hit the picture button you have to hold the camera still for about 10-12 seconds because if you move the picture will become blurry. I love that the pictures don't have borders i think it makes the overall photo look nicer.All in all though Ive decided to return the product. " 
 "This entire listing needs to be fixed. If you read this listing very carefully you'll come off confused. The reason is there are two versions of this camera:10 Megapixels with a black and white/color switch5 Megapixels with no color switchThe description alternates between both and there's no way to be sure which one you'll get. Most likely you'll get the 5. I ordered the camera 4 times and I got the 5 megapixel version each time. My advice - don't order it. The 5 is considerably worse and not worth the money. Pay a little extra for a better Kodak camera like the Kodak Smile (I got it for only $25 more) and stay away from this model unless they can guarantee you the better version.The 5 megapixel has bad low light performance. Blurry pictures everyone needs to stand perfectly still like they're taking a photo in 1891. Don't get it. " 
 "Love it. This camera is so much fun! I almost bought the fujifilm one but decided on this one since the price of film is a much better deal for this camera. Everyone in the family loves it.Is it HD pictures? no. But it is more for the instant gratification of having the photo in your hand after taking the photo.Some tips when taking a picture for instant print: Do not keep clicking the shutter button. If you do it will print that many pictures in a row.Once you take a picture wait around 5 to 10 seconds and you will hear the camera starting to print..It has a little delay it needs to think!Also I was buying only the kodak 2x3 zinc paper but found the HP Zinc paper to work just as well but for a lower price.OH and some how I missed this... all the prints are stickers! Thats right you can remove the backing and it is a sticker. " 
 "Love Love. When Kodak announced they will release a Zink instant camera I could not be happier. As an owner of the Polaroid Zink Snap and Fuji Instax 9 I couldn\x92t wait to get my hands on one. Growing up we always had Kodak around the house and we have many pictures that we printed with our Kodak\x92s. And I am very excited about the PrintomaticFirst of all for the price of $69.99 it is a great value and the design looks great you can choose a yellow or grey color version. The Zink quality is great with the camera.Included in the box is: Printomatic USB cable QSG Hand Strap. (Note no paper is included so make sure you get some of those as well)Even though Fuji Instax is similar price Instax quality doesn\x92t compare to the Kodak Zink quality. Also with Kodak it is a digital camera so you can save the pictures you take and most important cost per print is $0.50 for Zink and it is close to $1 for FujiIt was very simple to insert the paper into the camera back door just make sure blue paper is facing downwards  which will print out in first print and it cleans the cameraVery simple to use choose color or black and white option then just snap. And picture will print out very fast.All in all I highly recommend this as your instant option " 
 "Beautiful design but extremely poor quality images. Beautiful design but extremely poor quality images.  I have used the Polaroid Snap and the difference In price make the difference in quality. Being an instant photographer I do not recommend this camera. "  "Ignore the Karen's.. 1. So much complaining about  picture quality it's under $50 relax people. Back in the days instant print cameras weren't that high quality anyway. The nostalgic aspect is what counts. 2. Even more complaints about a charger not being included bruhhhh in today's age dont we all have like 10 USB cables hanging around anyways for every other device in the household?!?!? 3. $.50 per print isn't even that bad considering you don't need to print them somewhere/ at home. THEY'RE INSTANT!.For the price nobody should be complaining. This generation is never satisfied with anything. Bruhhh.... " 
 "Stopped working after ~40 pictures. I wanted so much to like this camera. At first it worked although not reliably. The battery charge doesn't last long. Occasionally I had to troubleshoot by turning the power off and on or taking the paper out and putting it back in. It's cute and the picture quality was what I was expecting for the price. But it became unreliable and did not work at all by the time we took it on family vacation. I tried fiddling with it to get it to work again installed a new pack of paper only to have one picture come out and then none again. It's been too much fuss. I thought I was saving money by going with this camera instead of the Fuji instant camera because the film is more expensive but I wish I had bought that instead. " 
 "Camera works great and 3 stars are for picture quality. Camera works great and 3 stars are for picture quality. Color pictues are sort of greyish but its perfect for a kid or some sort od journaling or scrap booking. Love the backing sticker paper. And someone put that camera comes with photo paper no it does not. Need to buy it separetely. "  "Don\x92t waste your money. My daughter got this for her birthday 1 month ago- and it will not turn on anymore. The picture quality to begin with was pretty low- but she\x92s 9 and loved it anyway. She has taken less than 25 pictures and she went to use it and a red light was flashing. We thought it was the battery so we charged it but the red light still flashes and the camera won\x92t turn on. We used the reset button and thought we had it back on line- tried to take another pic and halfway through printing got the red flashing light again. Now there is no light the camera won\x92t turn on and the reset button doesn\x92t reset it. Complete trash. Very disappointed. I\x92d go with another brand. " 
 "Fun lil camera and almost instant prints. Takes a little getting used to since this version doesn\x92t have an lcd screen but it\x92s lots of fun to use and having instant wallet size prints is cool.I haven\x92t downloaded the pics to my pc yet so I honestly cannot attest to the quality of full size photos but they should be adequate for fun photos.The cost of zink packs equals about $.50 a print so get one and have fun making small photos for your scrapbooks to fill extra space on your pages. " 
 "60 bucks is a little spendy for this thing since the pictures are so horrible.. This is fun for a kid with the instant printing on sticker paper. However it is a little disappointing for 3 main reasons:1. The photo paper costs at least 40 cents a picture which I would gladly pay if the camera wasnt set up to print accidental photos constantly. If you barely touch or accidentally graze the trigger with a strand of hair it takes a photo. This means a lot of junk accidental photos are taken and 40 cent 2x3 paper wasted.2. The quality of the photos is TERRIBLE. I'd rather have 3 mp with color that isn't completely washed out. We are very fair skinned people and all turn out like Casper on the camera. The photos look like photos you find from the 70s that weren't properly stored. Actually they look worse because everything looks like you edited the pictures to turn the exposure up all the way.  I bought this based on good reviews online but with the horrible quality of the pictures I'm shocked anyone would give this camera more than 3 stars.3. The pictures do save to an sd card If you install one which is the main reason i bought this over other brands. However iits kind of a bummer that you cant see your pictures before you choose to print them. Every photo has to waste a 40 cent zink paper. So having the sd card is really kind of pointless since you can't retrieve photos on the camera and print them later from the camera. You have to pull the sd card and put it in a computer or something to print at another time (which with the awful quality of the photos I cannot imagine ever wanting to do anyway).I think my 9 year old will enjoy this anyway but even her first comment was \ "how come the color is so bad?\ " Its shockingly bad even to a 9 year old. " 
 "Great and Super fun with vintage feel. Love this camera! It's very easy to use. It doesn't come charged so if you're having trouble with it plug it in (hold the power button to turn it on). There are three lights on the bottom left: battery printing and SD card. If the battery is white it's fine to use if printing is white it's printing and if SD card is red there's no micro SD (white means there is). The pictures it takes are super cute and very fun but don't buy this if you're expecting iPhone or other camera quality pictures. They're different than polaroid prints but are very similar quality to cameras from the early 2000s/2010s or so. You can see everything but it's not going to be super vivid and the color will be a little off. Also try to take pictures in light but as you can see in the last photo the camera won't always adjust to super bright light like another camera would.I bought this as the used (like new description) and it was in perfect condition. The box had a slight mark but had never been opened. This product comes with 10 sheets of paper but if you're looking to buy more amazon has HP Zink 2x3 sticky back paper that is cheaper than the Kodak brand of the same exact thing and works just as well. Really no difference just a few dollars more.Last thing: in the instruction manual it comes with the black and white vs color switch instructions seem to be slightly wrong. If you can see the three colorful dots your photo will come out in color. If the dots are grey and black it'll be black and white. The manual seemed to reverse this so I figured I'd mention it. :) " 
 "Great gift for someone who travels and likes to keep photos on their wall or gift them to friends!. This little gadget is great for young and old alike! Instructions are very simplistic with 8 steps and easy to follow photos to guide the user to setting up their new printomatic! The colours are surprisingly phenomenal for how tiny these pictures are. Hand in photo for size comparison. "  "Very cute light weight great value for the price paid. I really like this camera. It's light and compact having great features and it's very beautiful. The image quality is not very good but the colors are very vibrant. And for the price paid I would not complain. Just really love the camera! " 
 "Good instant camera not great. Daughter wanted an instant camera for Christmas. I knew nothing about them and hadn't used one since the old Polaroid days. Lots of her friends have the Instax type cameras but after looking at all the options I decided to go the Zink route instead. On the plus side...the prints come out quickly and you don't have to wait for them to 'develop' the camera saves every image to an SD card (bought separately) so you can keep shooting even if you run out of paper the Zink film/paper is cheaper than Instax and my daughter loves that every print can also be used as a sticker if you peel off the back. The main downside the prints from this camera are not as clear or vibrant as the ones I've seen from Instax cameras. The fact that you get a print AND a digital images kind of makes up for that in my opinion though. She's very happy with the camera and I'm happy that when she needs film refills they don't cost as much as some. " 
 "I couldn't find a better gift for my teenager. I couldn't find a better gift for my teenager !!!What a great idea not to have to go on a computer and go the old way and those teenagers have the pictures so professional and so quick I definitely highly recommend this camera especially for this price.I took the Gray because I like the color better than the yellow it's very cool.Abe. "  "Worst purchase of the year.. This is the worst camera ever!!!! All photos came out blurry. What a waste of money. I bought more photo paper in case I just got bad paper and they are still awful photos. I can\x92t even tell what the photo is of. I do not recommend: it didn\x92t even come with a charging cable. I had to go buy one because I don\x92t have android stuff in my house. I\x92m really disappointed as this was a gift. " 
 "Very unhappy with it.. Unless I managed to get a defective one. The instructions were pretty basic instructions.  Load the paper in color card first point and shoot.I took a picture of a bright flower in the garden.  The color was totally drained out and faded.  When I took the picture the flower was in the frame... The flower was totally out of frame and not at all where I had pressed the button.I thought 'maybe I didn't hold it still long enough?' The second picture was exactly the same dull color and not the frame I shot.  I spun the camera around and took one of my face.  Faded but my face for some reason looked red like I was overheated.The next picture loaded wrong and half of the picture was white.I charged it before I used it.  I just happened to find a charging cable considering one isn't included with the camera which was weird and frustrating.I was excited for it to come it was such a cool looking camera but what comes out of it is awful. " 
 "NOT as advertised! Warning!. Not as advertised. No charging cable included.  No button to change from color to b&w only 5mp not 10 as described.  This was a christmas gift for my 8yr old.  So we rolled with it.  Well insult has been added to injury because now it only took 3 pics and it is flashing red and white signalling an error.  The user manual which you don't get with the product either has to be downloaded from here...which is the wrong product.  So now what? LOL! What a joke.  Amazon ia sending me a replacement but who knows what I am getting! I have to send this original one back. But am waiting for the replacement.  Just in case I need to send them both.  What a poor experience overall.  Should have went with the Fuji.  I am really disappointed in this Kodak product as it stands now. " 
 "Where is my USB cable!. So frustrated. I ordered this for my nine-year-old granddaughter's birthday. We opened the box and there was no \ "USB\ " cable in the box. I contacted Amazon and they promptly sent another camera. Ugh! I just opened the box and the carrying strap and the USB cable are missing out of the second one. The camera appears to be working with a partial charge it was sent with???  I am a confused consumer as on the camera box it says no USB cable included but inside the camera box the  book says it is included and to charge the camera first before use.\ " How do you explain this to a nine year old... " 
 "Underwhelming not enough to return the product but probably won\x92t be using it very often. BEWARE PICTURE QUALITY IS NOT AT ALL VIBRANT AS ADVERTISED!!!!I like this camera it\x92s a fun little thing to have but it works about 60% of the time. Picture quality is passable definitely isn\x92t what I was expecting based on the advertised images. The pictures that print out remind me of the original Polaroid cameras which has a charm of its own but I was initially very disappointed. Also had a really hard time getting the camera to print it kept pushing out blank pictures or pictures with a large white stripe on the end. I don\x92t want to spend any more money on this thing but if you\x92re willing getting an SD card may be your best bet if you want to capture the pics and print them later. I hate to say it but save your money and look for something else. " 
 "Variable Versions of Product Being Distributed - PAY ATTENTION. We received the 5mp camera instead of the 10mp camera - according to reviews this has happened to other people as well. Thought it could be user error but obviously it's not. Other customers have had the same issues (pink-shaded images blurry pictures extremely poor quality). It seems this version simply doesn't print good quality pictures and did not come with a charging cord although the cord is a simple micro USB cable. We were disappointed.  Looking at 10mp reviews it seems that camera produces better quality prints. 10mp also comes with 3 distinguishing lights in the bottom left corner of the back panel and the option to print in black & white. Got in contact with Amazon product support (after going through another product) and was able to get a full refund.Explanation given - the option which includes the camera ONLY is 5mp while the bundle lists a 10mp camera - I've seen other reviews which refer to the 10mp with excellent photo quality option to switch to B&W photos etc. If that is what you are looking for - pay attention & select the bundle. " 
 "Don\x92t buy an instant camera if you want quality pictures. It\x92s just for fun.. I didn\x92t get this camera to take extraordinary photos. I bought it knowing that it would be like a Polaroid with low quality. It\x92s a fun camera to have to be able to take pics in the moment to stick wherever or just to have that memory. It gets 5 stars because it does what they are meant to. So many people complain about the pic quality but a zinc photo paper will never be the best quality. It\x92s the nostalgia of the camera and being able to have a real photo printed and in your hands within a few seconds. " 
 "Good with a Couple of Irritating Flaws. This is a neat little camera and I like the quality of the picture for what they are. It's super light and easy to use. You do have to be careful framing the shot but they indicate that in the instructions so fair enough. BUT...The picture button is seriously flawed and seems designed to waste film. I pressed it for a test picture. It played a little tune which I assume meant it took a picture. But there was no other indication and it didn't print for quite some time so I took another picture. It played a tune. And I waited. It eventually printed both pictures. I put the camera down. Picked it up and fat fingered another picture.Long story short the button presses too easily and has no rim protection to prevent accidental shots. And although it's probably a pro that it can take multiple shots before waiting for printing to finish it's a learning curve. I'd give it at least another star if they protected the shoot button (and power button) and added a couple second delay to prevent double shots.Lastly even for a simple camera with simple instructions they are lacking. Does the camera auto power off? They don't say. What do the indicator lights on the back mean? Does red mean its charging or charged? Blinking versus non blinking. Simple things overlooked that I have to figure out through trial and error. " 
 "Don't bother wasting your money!!. Let me start off by saying that with each packet of film you buy you only get 5 sheets. That is FIVE pictures and they are not cheap!Now let's start with this camera even if you get the target of your picture within the frame you cannot know if it will actually be centered. Out of 15 pictures 3 came out ok. Make sure what ever you are taking a picture of does not have the ability to move or you just wasted a sheet of film. Bad lighting no flash crappy picture! oh it has flash it just picks and chooses when it wants to come on you don't have control of it. You better have a steady hand! Even if your target can't move you better not either as you will get a blurred picture!Needless to say this thing was MASSIVE disappointment I wish I could return it but I have been so busy I didn't get my return request in on time.  PLEASE find a better product this things isn't worth the plastic it used to be made with or even the box it is shipped in!! " 
 "Easy to use.. Purchased this camera and case for our 'very adult' 7 year old granddaughter.Needs to be charged but lasts a long time. An adult did that as well as load film.  Better quality pictures if taken outdoors.  'OK' pictures if indoors.  It does have a view finder and very easy to focus.but again better quality picture if taken outdoors. "  "Good looks very disappointing substance. Tl;Dr: This is a good LOOKING product and does exactly what it says it will. However photo quality is not at all what it should be and the mechanics are quite finicky. If you must have an instant-develop camera keep looking.I researched instant-print cameras and this was supposed to be a good choice if you want a photo larger than two postage stamps put together. Unfortunately more research after I got it home and tried it out (and assumed I must be doing something wrong) tells me that no it's just not a good product for what it's supposed to do: take and print photos.The quality of the pictures is terrible. Blurry with washed out colors and color that is just plain incorrect (a medium jewel purple came out almost pastel etc). The lack of control over flash is a serious flaw as the camera's sensor seems to think it needs to go off any time you're indoors and not in the very brightest of lighting so on top of everything the photos often come out seriously over-exposed. I get the feeling you'd get much better results taking pics from about six feet away (as is the intended use) but didn't waste more film trying that out.You're better off snapping pictures with your phone and taking a few extra seconds to just print them out in a small size. Very disappointed. Really wanted this to work so I could easily take pictures for journaling but the photo quality is a non-starter especially for the price.In addition:- The button to take a photo is VERY sensitive so don't hold your finger anywhere near it until you're ready to take a picture- The frame in the viewfinder is extreeeemely inaccurate for photos that are taken within a few feet of the subject. I went through probably three to five shots before I figured out how to take them without getting several inches cut off of each side.- Definitely get extra film out of the gate (and I recommend a little case too otherwise it's just sitting out waiting to get scratched or banged around). The starer pack mine came with had five sheets not ten and I went through all of them just on the learning curve. " 
 "Let me talk about Kodak Printomatic Camera.. I'm extremely happy that I found and ordered this Camera from Amazon. It takes excellent pictures and I'm not even a professional photographer. Very simple and very easy to use. Just try not to drop it and it should work fine lol. I really do not have anything negative to say about Kodak Camera. You don't need an internet connection for this Camera. No app installation. Just point shoot and the picture comes out very good.This is also good for IDs and passport. This is also very helpful for just in case you need repairs and no one shows up and constantly give you excuses take pictures as proof of evidence and neglecting the workwrite a letter and take that person to court. " 
 "Neat little camera and lots of fun. Saw this and loved the retro colors and the ability to print instant pictures that are also stickers. It didn't disappoint. Love that a switch on top turns it from color to B&W photos. And if I want I can put in a micro sd card and save photos to it. "  "garbage. Camera is a waste of money. Images are always off center because you have to look through the viewfinder and unless you can look through a tiny hole with two eyes it seems to end up completely wrong-even if you swear you \ "center\ " it in the white viewfinder square. Photo quality and colors are horrible. Even taking photos in bright sunlight doesn't help. There is no feature to \ "cancel\ " a print so if the subjects move you end up with a blurry mess of a photo. There is also no indicator of which number photo you are taking in the stack from inside... so you don't know if you have 1 photo left of 10... which is annoying when you think you take the perfect photo and it doesn't print b/c you are out of film. I would say this is in range with cameras with film from the 1970's/80's because a pack of film has 10 sheets and maybe you will get 2 decent faded color photos out of the batch. Save your money or go with another company. " 
 "10MP sensor 2MP pictures. Camera might have a 10MP sensor but it definitely does not take 10MP photos. Every file it's saved so far has only been 1.9MP. Not sure if it's a firmware issue or I have a defective product. There's also multiple versions of this camera from my research. One has a switch for black and white. The one I received does not.UPDATE: On the box it says \ "Up to 5MP\ " so apparently I received the 5MP variety of camera. Luckily I don't need high definition printouts for what I'm using it for but still this is an incredibly poor image quality for 2020 let's say if you just wanted to use it for its digital function. It would have been nice if it could also be used as a printer to print shots from your cellphone. It would have been a much cheaper alternative to other printer brands. " 
 "Jams constantly. I am so disappointed by this product. I bought for my daughter for her birthday and after just a couple uses the picture printing aspect jammed. We tried everything to fix it but could not unjam it. I request the return to replace the product. I recieve the replacement camera and my daughter used it 3 times only placing one piece of printer picture paper in at a time as to hopefully not jam it. But some how it jammed again on the 3rd picture. My daughter has been wanting a camera for years and I finally decided to get her one. I did a lot of research to get her a good camera for a decent price that would also be fun for her with the instant printing. I am so frustrated by this camera. " 
 "Fun and on the run. This camera is great for on the go instant photography. There have been many complaints on the film quality but one needs to know what this camera is for it is for joy and fun on the run not for high resolution art photography.I have several DSLR SLR and other high resolution/definition cameras.  My favorite is still my Fujifilm X100 35mm fixed lense.I have with more than a few decades of photography experience. I saw that there were many complaints on the reviews indicating that the color and quality of the images were not \ "picture perfect\ " or the best. However individuals buying this Kodak Printomatic need to understand that you are buying this for the fun and joy of on the go photography. It is for instant gratification and also fun.The quality of the image could be better. I've tested it out on several indoor and outdoor conditions on portraits and objects but I still stand by that this camera has a very simple ease of use. The coloration is a little too warm for my tastes and comes out more warm than white balanced. But the feature of low quality SD card saving of the image is truly useful for post production editing.Overall because I bought my camera on sale for $31 which comes with 10 zink film and then bought another three packs of 20 zink film for a total of $24 for 60 pieces of zink film. For a product of around $50 for 70 pieces of zink film I would say this was a pretty good purchase.Will update in six months if there are any new developments. However if there is no updates consider it still a good novel camera that does the trick. If you need better quality go for a fixed lense or newer DSLR. " 
 "Instant gratification printing but short on optical quality. Pros:  this product definitely captures the spirit of the moment as you can take a snapshot and print it immediately. Also the zink paper technology is awesome and is plastic coated smudge proof and has a sticky back. There\x92s no toner needed as the technology is built into the paper and the printer heats the paper to produce the image.Camera includes a micro SD card slot to store photosCons: sadly the optics for the camera are not great and the picture quality is Meh <U+0001F611>I wish that Kodak would put out a better quality product that had a sensor and optics worthy of the Kodak name- I am giving the camera to a teenager as a graduation gift for the \x93fun?aspect of using it.I think that the printer portion of the product is great but the weakness of the camera lens makes this more of a toy than a serious photography tool.Personally I find that using my mobile phone with just a stand alone zink printer yields a much better quality print " 
 "Terrible.. This was a gift for my daughters 8th birthday. She has had very little experience taking pictures with a camera but she was able to easily take pictures the problem is that the coloring is way off and the subject of the photo was always cut off. I chalked it up to user error thinking she is still learning to use a camera. After repeatedly having the same outcome with every picture I decided to try it myself and took a picture of her and made sure I had her centered in the image box on the camera. The picture came out and she was partly cut off. Again I thought maybe I just moved a little so I decided to take a picture of a Lego set and had the camera sitting on the table so it couldn\x92t move at all. The picture came out and again the it was cut off and the coloring is way off. What a piece of junk. I added pictures to show how it\x92s cutting it off and the coloring. The first picture is a picture of what I took the picture of. The second picture I had taken my iPhone and taken a picture through the lens of the Kodak camera to show that the area with the frame around it is exactly around the Lego set and yet it\x92s still cut off. Don\x92t buy this camera unless you want a worthless camera that cuts off your subjects and turns the colors way off.Our older daughter has an Instax and we should have just gone with the same one for our younger daughter. So disappointed. " 
 "There's a difference in the 2020 build vs previous version.. EDIT AS OF 2021: I've written to Kodak about my questions and they have responded that YES there was a change in design. It is no longer marketed the same as the first model. I've put in notes here.I stumbled on this brand while in search of a fun camera to replace an old one. I was looking forward to trying out the Color Mode switch it claimed to provide. But here's what I discovered:1: There is NO Color Mode switch anywhere to be seen anymore.2: The Power button is set beside the Shoot button on top of the camera instead of the back.3: The lid for the Zink paper printer is now detachable.4: There is only one strap holder on the side of camera.5: There is NO USB wire for charging. (Micro USB Type B to be specific. Just find at local tech shop)6: You are still provided with free 10 sheets of Zink paper7: New feature - You can snap multiple times for a moment while the printer mechanism starts rolling.8: 5MP photo quality.For the price and with the free Zink paper it's still not bad it really is a fun camera. Thankfully there's a MicroSD slot so I can do practice shoots.I'm more upset about the lack of marketing for this updated version-- So please read this before you buy the item. " 
 "Disappointed.. I was hoping to love this camera especially since it\x92s Kodak brand however I\x92m very disappointed. The print time is extremely slow- which isn\x92t a huge deal on its own But when you pair it with inconsistent color/tone and not great quality images it makes for a bad purchase.I was hoping for better from this camera. I\x92ve used the Instapix Mini 9 (I think it\x92s called? I borrowed it from a friend awhile back) and that had better quality photos with more consistent coloring.I bought this camera to take daily progress pics during my fitness program but I wish I had gone with something different.My advice? Don\x92t spend your money on this camera. " 
 "Fun & easy to use camera.. I love the simplicity of this camera. I like the low tech no screen. Old school style view finder. Nice tool to teach beginners the world of photography. I really like the small 2x3 prints. It makes them easier to store and collect. With a micro SD card I can take to Walmart or any place that can print photos from a SD card and print larger or make copies for gifts. The ZINK technology is really amazing. That was the downside to the old Polaroids was that you had to always have viles of ink on your to refill the camera and it was messy and the least fun part about them. This is a nice clean alternative. I love the fun bright colors available. In a sea of black cameras this stands out and really helps get people to look at the camera without asking. Have to be quick to catch the initial reaction on a print. It is a fun challenge. Perfect size not too big or small and a great point and shoot fun camera for anyone young and old to have fun with. Make sure you watch and read many different reviews for any product you buy. It is important to do some research to make sure a purchase is right for you. I highly recommend the Kodak PRINTOMATIC Digital instant print camera for a fun easy to use camera. Great for Scrapbooking or school projects or a nice collectable hobby. " 
 "Waste would never buy again. We've had this a month now and it was a total waste of money. Bought as a present and the first day (after reading instructions) it did not work as expected. It kept acting like it would load the paper keep loading and then spit out a blank piece. (Yes the paper was in correctly we triple checked this)  Unfortunately i had bought so far ahead of the birthday that it was outside of return dates. When the pictures would actually develop they were horrible quality. The replacement film is not cheap either. Thinking about trashing it at this point already because it is almost useless. Works every 1 of maybe 3 picture attempts. " 
 "exactly as expected. I went back and forth on this camera or the fuji model. After looking at several factors I decided to give this one a try and I'm not mad. I did read reviews about a delay that some weren't expecting after taking a pic to when it started printing the pic so they ended up printing several pic that were all them same. So I did anticipate that and didn't find the delay was that bad. The view finder is a little off and did get some getting used to. It does not come with a charger so you will need your own. The pictures aren't of the highest quality(but not terrible) but when you don't pay a lot - you get what you pay for. I was able to find alternative paper at a lower cost since Kodak paper was out of stock. I haven't used it (alt pic paper) yet - but once I take a pic I will compare and update. Overall if you are looking for a camera for yourself or loved one to play around with and have that instant gratification of having a copy - then this one will be perfect. It may take a couple shots to get it figured out but once you have it down its happy picture taking! " 
 "Really bad quality pictures. My girlfriend bought these cameras for our wedding and they were a real disappointment. The cameras DIDN'T come with small memory cards and DIDN'T come with CHARGERS which is INSANE!!As you can see in the pictures the quality picture is not good comparing with instant polaroid pictures. The camera took a couple of seconds to turn on (slow thinker) and also to take the picture. The person who took the picture and people in the picture had to stay EXTREMELY STILL during and COUPLE SECONDS AFTER taking the picture a so there could be a decent outcome. It took FOREVER to print. And lastly they are really fragile. In my opinion they are not worth AT ALL the money. Don't buy these cameras! " 
 "Not worth the money. I bought this for a small project I wanted to do. I thought it would be perfect. But these are the worst pictures I\x92ve ever seen. I think the old polaroid cameras from the 90\x92s had better quality than this. I followed all the directions and used the blue color sheet first like it said too. The pictures are still horrible quality. Unfortunately I didn\x92t start using it right away so I\x92m out of my return window. This was a huge waste of money. "  "Poor quality photos and a frustrating little bit to know.... This camera produces fair-quality pictures if you take the picture outdoors if you are extremely still and if the subject is extremely still. I bought one as did my mom. We both experienced the same issues:1. Paper occasionally gets stuck...won't pull out of the camera.2. Directions for loading paper can be seen--with a magnifying glass--and even then they are comprehensibly unclear.3. The button for taking photos is located in the standard place but due to the fact that the photo is taken with a quick push of the button rather than holding it down for a couple of seconds hitting the button occurs often which means that you've just taken a photo of the ground or your shirt...wherever it happens to be pointing when you accidentally pushed the button. This can be expensive.4. There is no \ "film empty\ " indicator so just when you think you clicked a great shot...oops! No film!Good Points:1. The camera is compact and clean-looking.2. The sticky back feature is great. " 
 "Extremely dissatisfied. The photo quality is about the same as a disposable camera from the 90s which is the look I was going for but for some may be off-putting. The no-ink thing is kinda cool and I like the small picture size.HOWEVER?The big reason I am giving this camera such a low review is because it does not have the features that it was supposed to have. This camera was supposed to have a black and white option switch on top and it does not. Moreover the back of my camera does not fit properly and as a result I end up with this awkward gap where the back does not stay on. As this point I\x92d rather get the disposable camera and get my pictures from Walgreens.I was planning on using this camera to take pictures of my students to put on their end of year awards but I don\x92t think I can deal with the back not staying on. Kodak please fix the design so the back actually fits and is easier to work with!! " 
 "Kodak should just close its doors...... It's functionality isn't very well thought out.  Yes it's a cheap camera and we gifted it to our daughter but I just feel it could have been so much more.  I don't see this thing lasting very long.  God help us if we were to ever drop it.  I also think adding internal memory would not have drastically changed the costs to much but would have added a lot more instant enjoyment.  THis is a good cheap gift for a young kid but they will run though the film very quickly.  It's is really a shame it can't print to instant from an internally saved image.  This just falls short in so many areas.  Kodak should just call it and close its doors.  It's so irrelevant to consumer electronics today. " 
 "Photo quality poor spend money elsewhere. For the price I am a little disappointed that the photos come out so blurry and slightly blue. I like that it has a sticker on the back but if you are choosing between this and a similarly priced Instax Mini buy that instead and put tape on the back. Two stars because the shape and look is charming and it is easy to use but ultimately does not produce a quality picture. "  "Instant instant print convert. I went into this purchase expecting a terrible camera and being okay with that because I really enjoy the vintage look of the photos everyone has posted in their reviews.I love it.I was so giddy taking a photo of a few things around my apartment! One press and the picture will be taken without flash double press and the flash will go off.It was fast and easy to figure out the printing feature.I bought a new- like used blue model from Karma Electronics. It came with paper in the camera and a fresh packet in the box (which was worse for wear). There is a small defect a scratch on the glass but it does not effect picture quality or the aesthetic of the machine.I purchased this camera to take photos of dogs at work from far away- about 3 feet to be exact- this camera will not perform well with macro or high detail shots. " 
 "Not worth the money. Got this for my almost 11 year old instead of the instax camera that broke. And we got very disappointed with the pictures quality. First of its very unclear how to use it. We pressed that button all kinds of ways - one long hold half way hold and then all the way quick press even double press.. but it doesn't seem to matter.. it captured the picture whenever it felt so.. sometimes even like 10-15 seconds after pressing that button. They all turn out very yellow and very blurry. Also the insert stated that there is a cable to charge the camera - there was none and the box looked unopened before so clearly the manufacturer forgot to put it. " 
 "Don't buy this. I got this in February. It came with no cords and no real directions on how to set it up. I have NEVER been able to get it to work and can't get a response from the company to return it. Don't waste  your money!! "  "Kodak Printomatic. One of our granddaughters asked for the Kodak Printomatic  for Christmas. When I saw it listed with an appearance of a camera and with the name Kodak I thought it was a camera. In my opinion it should be in the toy section. It uses 2\ "x3\ " special paper onto which are printed extremely fuzzy depictions of people or objects. I only found this out a few days ago. She was showing me how it worked and printed a depiction of my husband. You could barely tell it was a person. She is 9 years old and was having fun with it. She was putting the fuzzy little pictures into an album. I actually was very shocked as I thought we were getting her little camera. " 
 "Good buy!. So I wasn\x92t entirely sure what to expect when I ordered this because there were mucked reviews. For the price and the fact that it would arrive the same day I couldn\x92t resist!So I received it same day as promised and a lot of people said that it didn\x92t come with a charger. If you read the box and instructions a charger isn\x92t included. It uses a micro USB charger. My husband had one so I charged it with that. It also came with some photo paper.The camera itself works pretty well it takes some getting used to because you think it\x92s going to have more in the picture than it does. I\x92m getting better at it though. The photos are not super clear but they\x92re not really fuzzy either. Depending on the lighting the color can look weird.Overall so far I\x92m super happy with it. It\x92s a fun little camera and to top it all off they pictures are also stickers. " 
 "This broke in a hot minute. I got this for my 8-year old for her birthday and she was so excited about it she immediately started taking pictures. The quality of the print is not great particularly for indoors but she's no professional so she was really loving it. One week in while she was changing the paper the backdoor stopped closing properly and started leaving a little slid on one of the side. Since then all her images are useless with lines across them from poor exposure. There is light going into the paper so the images are not rightly developed/printed. this is a shame because it's a nifty good looking simple device that could and should be made to withstand the use of a child since it is precisely made for kids. I'm disappointed I wasted money like this and just gifted a similar camera to a friend but went with another brand. " 
 "Very low quality photos cheap design slow reaction time. I wasn't expecting much but this camera is a serious disappointment. Very low quality photos cheap design slow reaction time. Some of my coworkers have other brands and models that work much better at a similar price point. I would've returned it if I wasn't in a backcountry alaskan lodge. "  "Junk. I got this for my children and it came with a \x93bundle package? The bundle didn\x92t even include film. It was just paper and paper clips to make a collage I guess? Also no charging cord which is fine but no film. Charged up and it just beeps and waits then eventually a picture comes out with no choice between black and white or color. Pic is so slow coming out. Tiny and blurry. I\x92m shocked this is Kodak. This is my 6 year olds third camera and by far the absolute worst. I thought he was getting an upgrade but nope. Total waste and I threw out the box. And his sister got one so now I\x92ve spent too much money on two pieces of junk. " 
 "Blurry pictures and doesn\x92t come with charger. I got the pink and the light blue one. They were Christmas gifts and we celebrate the 24th(today). They come with no charge to them and you have to buy your own charger cord and block. It takes an android charger. A little inconvenient for the kids that want to play with their toy on Christmas if everything is closed and you need a charger. The pictures are pretty blurry no matter how still you hold. For an 8 and 9 year old sure but that\x92s also not an age that they can hold their hands super steady and this is already a blurry camera. Our teens have the Fuji Polaroid and I would recommend spending the little bit more for the better quality. " 
 "Not what is advertised. This camera is not at all what is advertised?it\x92s doesn\x92t have a charger to start and it doesn\x92t come with the option of black and white vs color and no 10 second delay button. Also the shutter buttons is not on the side of the camera it\x92s on the top. Also the SD card application doesn\x92t work. It states it can use up to a 256 so when I used a 32 it came out blank so I couldn\x92t transfer photos to the computer. This is why I bought this particular camera was for that function and the other functions that it didn\x92t even come on the camera. Very disappointed. I called Amazon customer service and they were wonderful about refunding the price of the camera and the SD card. Amazon customer service gets 5 stars. The vender 0 !! " 
 "Orange pictures and not 10mp or color change option. Terrible customer service. Do not buy! The advertisement is for a 10mp camera with a color to black and white option. They will send you a 5mp camera with only one color mode. The seller took weeks to even response and responded with a robot response and didn\x92t even read my email. I emailed them back right away and they took another week to respond and say sorry we sent you the wrong one we can give you a free pack of photo paper. I said no I would like the correct camera I paid for or a refund. They took another week to respond saying they don\x92t make it anymore and I can return it if I want. My child was already so upset not being able to use her Christmas present after opening it and to find out it doesn\x92t even work the way it was sold as. I even bought extra paper and when I purchased the set so now I have to return the camera just to get my money back and have a set of paper for nothing. Also the pictures we did take to figure out the camera and wasn't the one we bought came out completely orange unless the flash comes on. The \x93flash?is supposed to come on automatically but doesn\x92t unless you are in a room that is completely black. I do not suggest the product or seller at all! " 
 "Nice fun poloroid style camera. We were under the impression that you could pick and choose which photo you would like to print but if you take the picture on the camera it automatically prints you do not get a choice. You can link the camera to your computer or phone and have it print the image of your choice that way though. Picture quality was fine and fun. I wouldn't say great but it was for our 11 year old daughter that just wanted to have a poloroid style camera and she loves it "  "Missing power cord.. The camera description stated it came with a power cord and the box it came in (original mfg box) listed the same but there was no power cord in the box. I had seen some previous reviews that complained about this but decided to buy the camera anyway. To be clear the power cord is a standard USB type used by other digital cameras e-readers and a host of digital devices. Easy to purchase at any Wal-Mart. Having said that though without the cord you can't use the camera right out of the box and the price you are paying assumes the cord is include and you don't have to run out and but another cord just to make the camera work. I think these units might be a run of rejects from Kodak who knew the cords did not make the box. This seller may or may not have know that but from previous reviews and stated returns I have to believe it may have been know. So I won't be purchasing from this buyer on Amazon again. " 
 "Second one and neither hold charge. Picture quality is horrible.. This makes my second one I have received since the first would not stay charged. Amazon sent me a replacement and low and behold this one doesn't charge either. I was able to get 2 pictures took and the quality is horrible. The flash is automatic so it's all up to the camera to decide if it will flash or not and the 2 pics I got to take one flashed in brightness and other didn't in darkness  the picture quality is worse than the 90s gas station cameras. This is ridiculous and the only thing my kid wanted for his bday. I now have to send this one back to get my refund and all I can say is take a risk getting this. " 
 "Really disappointed in the build quality. I bought this for my 12 year old daughter for her birthday as she really wanted one and we were about to go on vacation. After it arrived she did not receive it right away as she and we wanted to make sure that she had enough film for the trip so it was two weeks before she actually received it.  Upon the first use the door that encloses the film pack into the camera literally popped off of the back of the camera and all of the pieces came apart.  I put the pieces back together but it just pops apart again.  Really disappointing my other two daughters actually picked the Fuji version and they worked flawlessly and I had higher hopes for a Kodak version but I guess that I was wrong. " 
 "Great Camara!!. Love how simple and easy it's to operate creates great photos can't believe it's so inexpensive I would totally recommend this to anyone specially for inexpensive gifts. "  "Don't do it. If you want good quality instant photos look elsewhere. These are blurry even when taken in full daylight. Also the flash never worked and the viewer window seemed misaligned with how the photos actually looked. Maybe I got a defective one but I was not at all impressed. Tried to initiate a return but got an automated message saying \ "this item is non-returnable.\ " Don't waste your money. " 
 "Fuzzy No charger useless strap. Terrible...  Fuzzy no charger useless strap1st... It does not come with a charger...  at all.  I see others complaining about the same thing. I just looked back at the description and it does not mention charger. I usually check for batteries/ chargers before giving gifts I could have swore it was included. Not sure if they just took it off the description but regardless it\x92s not included.  It needs a micro cable.2nd..  it comes with a strap and directions to connect the strap but the directions don\x92t match the camera.  There is no hole for the strap on the side.3rd..  We were able to print 1 picture but it was a horribly fuzzy picture. See picture included.I\x92m returning this.  It\x92s junk.  Very disappointing for a Kodak product. " 
 "Wrong Item/Inaccurate Description. Received this item to gift as a Christmas present and when we opened it we found we were shipped the wrong product. Our camera did NOT have the switch to alternate between color photos and black/white photos and the product description on the marketing images states it is a 10mp camera that can utilize up to a 256gb micro SD card. However other description areas and the camera box states it is a 5mp camera with a 32gb micro SD card capacity. I am returning in hopes that I will receive the camera as advertised with at least the color changing switch. This is embarrassing for Kodak as I can tell from other reviews that potentially 100's of other people received wrong products or were deceived by the misinformation in the marketing images. " 
 "what a joke!. This is the least intuitive piece of technology I've ever interacted with. You have to look up the PDF manual pretty much every use because something blinks and beeps and doesn't work. Now right after the return period the camera doesn't take the picture within the photo frame. I now have two pictures that look like I didn't even try to center the image. What a waste of money and time. I am so disappointed. "  "Super annoying and not reliable. So I got this for my 3 year old to start taking vacation pictures supervised of course. You have to hold the button down and the camera still for like 30 seconds to even get a picture that isn\x92t blurry additionally I don\x92t know what happened- but it worked only once and then either didn\x92t work at all or it printed out only 1/2 the picture. Meaning- 1/2 the photo paper was completely blank and white. I was so hopeful for this as I loved that the pictures were stickers for this photo journal for vacations we were doing- but nope! This camera isn\x92t the one! Super annoying and not reliable " 
 "Not reliable. I purchased this camera + extra film to use at my parent's 40th anniversary party. The idea was for people to take a picture of themselves stick it in a scrapbook then write a note to my parents as a memory/guest book.The initial pictures weren't great but I knew that ahead of time. What was frustrating was how blurry the pictures came out. You have to hold absolutely still before during and after hitting the picture button. Then you wait the pictures don't print quickly.The major problem came when we had to reload the film. We followed the directions but the camera wouldn't work. We'd take the picture the camera would make noise as if it was processing the picture but no pictures actually printed.I'm disappointed in this product and will return. " 
 "Stay still. Bought for my 9 year old who loves taking pictures. He enjoys it but gets mad when he sees how blurred the pictures come out. I took a few myself to help him with it and they were still fuzzy. You have to be very still while taking the picture and whatever your taking a picture of has to be still for a good 10-15 seconds to get a decent picture. If you take pictures of non moving objects and can be still enough shouldn't be a problem. Pretty simple to operate. It's fun but kind of expensive for the quality of pictures you get. Wouldn't buy again or recommend. Sorry " 
 "Too simplistic to take such crap pictures. I wish I had taken a picture of the photos it took. I was hoping for some cutesy old fashioned looking instant photos but this is so hard to take pictures with! And there is such a teeny tiny window of what actually gets taken! I tried to take 3 pictures of my husband and I and cut off multiple heads ears you name it. It's like you are taking the picture from 6 inches away when you're holding it as far as possible away from your face. And they were all colored weird (red toned and sepia feel) plus half of the time it just didn't work and nothing printed! Definitely not a good substitute for polaroid style photos like I was hoping for. " 
 "Not impressed. I expected a better product from Kodak. Takes forever to print barely holds a charge and the slightest movement makes the picture blurry. I bought it to do a photo guest book at our wedding unfortunately only about 10% of people got a decent picture and it was having to charge a lot of the reception time. Would not recommend "  "Should've read the reviews. Beating myself up for not reading the reviews more closely because like many other unsatisfied customers I also received No USB Cord with my purchase even though it's advertised to come with the camera. If anyone else with this problem knows where I can find one please let me know! Becasue I also can't seem to find a suitable substitute. DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT!! " 
 "Not the product I bought. Looks like this has happened to other customers with the reviews I have seen but I received the older model of the printomatic since mine does not contain the color/black and white shooting option or the lights on indicating whether the image is printing low on battery etc. It also does not come with a micro usb cable for charging is only 5MP when it is advertised at 10MP and it's only compatible with a micro sd card up to 32gb but I am hoping that is not the case with the newer model.Was extremely excited to get it in the mail to start using but now I have to go through the hassle of returning it and not knowing if I'll be able to get an exchange since Amazon does not know what is currently in their inventory and there is no option to do so. " 
 "Great for a 9 year old girl lower your expectations way down.. This was a gift for Xmas for my 9 year old. She freaking loves it.I do not.Prints are 0.50 cents each. Said 9 year old blew threw 100 in 4 days.Prints are blurry and terrible. Color is whack. Sometimes prints streaky. It\x92s basically like a 1970 Polaroid but in 2021.No micro USB cord. Luckily we have a billion but this surprised us.No instructions. Yes it\x92s point and shoot but what do the beeps mean? Is the first beep when it takes? Is the second beep when it takes the photo? Is the first when it focuses and the second when it captures? These details would be helpful in trying to get an image that isn\x92t blurry.All that said.If you have a 9 year old girl they will love it. Highlight of Christmas for her. Just lower your expectations way way down as a parent. It\x92s not your camera. But it lives up to the hype and is super fun if you\x92re 9! " 
 "Kinda beware. I got this along with extra film case sad cards etc for a family reunion thinking it would keep the kids occupied but the camera needs to be charged before use and we got frustrated becuz it kept saying it needed to be charged so I don\x92t know if it even works properly or not. Still it\x92s cheap and a fun idea for creating party memories. I just recommend playing with it before your party!! "  "Turned on but was not able to print any photos at our wedding!. Sadly we could not get this camera to work at our wedding reception. It was charged and set up as the instructions detailed. The camera turned on but the camera would not print a photo despite paper being loaded correctly. Sometimes the camera would print half of a photo then get jammed. We tried to take new photos after the heat of the moment on our vacation after the wedding and still could not get the camera to print anything. Also sadly because we went away on our honeymoon we were beyond the return window for this item and ate the cost. " 
 "No la recomiendo. La c\xe1mara es muy linda est\xe9ticamente  tiene un buen dise\xf1o y aparenta ser de buen material pero lo que realmente importa es la calidad de la imagen y es horrible!!! Las fotos salen muy feas feo color mala nitidez  quiz\xe1s tenga algo que ver el tipo de papel que hace que la calidad de la impresi\xf3n sea horrible !!!. La compre como regalo de navidad para mi nieta de 8 a\xf1os  la eleg?por la marca . Mi nieta qued?encantada al principio porque de aspecto es preciosa pero se ha ido desilusionando a medida que saca esas feas fotos !! Una pena . No la recomiendo para nada . Estoy totalmente arrepentida de haberla comprado !! "

 "Photo quality is really bad.. Folks I was pretty excited to give this gift to my kids for Christmas. Please know that the photo quality is really horrible. It's like something you would see from a kid's toy under $10. I am bummed about this as I like the \ "old school\ " photos and even miss purchasing Kodak products. The camera does look great but the photo set up with adding blue paper first every time is very odd. I would recommend a different better quality product. "  "Picture quality is horrible.

 "It does the job. I wasn't expecting the best pictures from this I just mainly bought it for fun and because the pictures having sticky backings. I'm glad I didn't buy these for their quality photos because some times the pictures look really bad. I think it's just me but I have trouble getting the pictures centered. The power button is so sensitive that it turns on if you put it in a bagpurse backpack etc so it ends up making you need the case they sell separately. If you don't mind the okay picture quality and just mainly like that they're stickers I say go for it. " 
 "Fun but frustrating. I was really excited about getting this camera for my boys (ages 7 and 9) to document their summer. While the concept is great we have run into all sorts of problems. I understand that when you put new paper in the camera it has to calibrate the printer. It\x92s supposed to do that one time with the blue sheet from the film package however often it ends of sending out the calibration page as well as 2-3 more sheets of blank photo paper.  This is super frustrating for my kids because often we don\x92t know if the photo they just took will actually print and it takes a good minute or two for it to spit out the random blank sheets. At that point either the moment they wanted to take a photo of has passed or they have just moved on to something else. The print quality of the photos isn\x92t great but they don\x92t seem to mind that since they are only putting them in their summer journals. If the camera would print consistently this would be a lot more fun for us to use. " 
 "dissapointed. so i just recieved my camera and its really cute and small  perfect for everyday use. however it did not come with a charger or any print sheets. i so happened to have bought extra but it didnt not come with the 10 pack sheet like advertised. also the cameradoes NOT have the switch to change from black and white to color like advertised theres no instant flash like advertised. the picture quality is okay  i wasnt expecting it to be high def or anything but you have to be in a well lit up room to get a decent photo since there is no flash. i was really excited for this camera too  but now im just like whommmp what a waste. i realllllly wanted to love this camera lol " 
 "Add me to the list of NO CHARGING CABLE!??. Add me to the list of NO CHARGING CABLE!?KODAK please this is ridiculous. The one I purchased as a gift was the grey and white model that came with a 10-pack of paper. I\x92ve seen others say and show pics of a cable included and some saying they had no charging cable and just had to \x93find one that worked? If they are really shipping these intended to have no charging cable that is just ridiculous. What could it cost? $0.08??We searched all over the packaging and no cable to charge with. Horrible when giving as a gift. " 
 "I wish I had gotten a Polaroid instant camera.. I bought this camera specifically to take to Peru. I like the idea of being able to give a printed copy to locals particularly kids. They like watching the process but temperature drastically effects print quality and clarity. I also had a problem with the camera not printing an entire picture consistently.I like in theory at least that since this isn\x92t a chemical development process that the pictures goes all the way to the edge and that the prints have a sticky backing. " 
 "Quite a disappointment. Pure novelty and little else.  I admit that I am indeed a photographer by trade and have pretty high standards.  The bit of novelty that this camera offers is worth far less than the non-novelty $50 price tag.The \ "viewfinder\ " is for the most part useless as it in no way matches the alignment of the final image.  I have reset the camera manually several times and it's just all over the place.Finally and what matters most the images are absolutely terrible.  It served a tiny purpose of giving our 100 y.o. grandmother a physical photo to hold her over while the other photos were being gathered and printed the images are beyond bad.  Like cell phone from 17 years ago bad.I am quite upset that I didn't get this sent back before the warranty period.  Maybe I'll get lucky if I take it up with Kodak directly.  I'm not as upset about the $50 but that they're getting away with selling such a substandard piece of pricey novelty. " 
 "Not worth it. The picture has to be very close and still. Even then its blurry and poor. There is a delay when u point and shoot. I figured this out after a few pics. It just stopped working at one point. I bought this for my sons grad party so kids could take pics and place them in a book and write a message. It was more trouble than its worth. The positive was it was cute and I liked the idea of being able to stick them immediately into a book. "  "Didn't work out of the box. I'm so disappointed. We have a new puppy so are eager to take & print photos that we can share. I researched several options online and liked the simplicity of this one and I have owned Kodak cameras before that worked well. This arrived yesterday so I charged it while we were at dinner. I also ordered paper on Amazon since this doesn't come with any printing paper (you'd think they might include a starter pack?). The instructions that come with this are negligible so I went online and read the user manual which is also pretty simple. It showed how to correctly load the paper. When I turned it on and took a photo nothing happened except the middle white light blinked. When I tried to take another photo I got a beeping noise and the middle light in the panel just kept blinking. When I tried to turn the camera off nothing. I scoured the online information and the FAQs don't mention this issue. I called the support number which is only open 9:30-5 Mon-Thursday and 9-1 Friday (not very helpful hours) and also emailed Kodak. My husband - who is more techie than I am - also wasn't able to figure out what the problem was.  I am going to return this. BTW I finally finally figured out there is a reset button next to the power outlet on the bottom. I gently put a paperclip in there and that effectively powered down the camera. I'm disappointed this didn't work but even more disappointed there were zero resources for me to resolve my issue here at home. " 
 "Utter trash. I can\x92t even tell you how useless this camera is. Please just don\x92t even waste your money. Images are blurry af you can barely tell what you\x92re looking at (yep I removed the lens protector calibrated it several time and played with the lighting.) This was a return after we went through $40 worth of film trying to troubleshoot it and then realized that the planned obsolescence of this item starts on photo number two. "  "Picture Quality - Terrible!. The design of the camera is stunning. Very sleek and beautiful. However after buying it I noticed that the pictures of the camera displayed are different. They are not the same. I also did not receive the charging cord that was supposed to be provided. The pictures also don't turn out great. Make sure not to move at all when taking the picture or else it will come out blurry. Even when you stay really still the pictures still came out a little blurry. I also had a hard time because the frame that you line the photo up in is off center. All my pictures came out off center and not how it was supposed to. It was very frustrating experience. I was expecting a lot better from this camera. " 
 "WASTE!!. Bought for my girlfriend and now wish I would\x92ve spent that money on anything else. Would\x92ve rather given her the money I spent in pennies than go through trying to get this thing to work. Tried several types of lighting. Tried to take 50 photos of several different things with different lighting. EVERY DAMN PICTURE CAME OUT SO BLURRY!! Imagine being back in school and putting on your one friends glasses and thinking \x93wow this is so blurry your blind!?. THATS THIS DAMN CAMERA. " 
 "Great for an instant print. Great price for an instant camera. Make sure to buy extra film it only comes with a starter pack. Doesn\x92t have a choice on which pictures to print so once you take the photo it prints. Definitely make sure you kid is older and better at taking pics. "  "A child's woes and frustration. My daughter so much wanted a camera that would feed the instant gratification center of her brain and allow her to be like her friends. Enter the Kodak printomatic. As adults we know this is a waste of money but who doesn't like having your view of the world instantly in hand. The pictures when they printed were over exposed and washed out but not cool like some retro artist. Usually the top or bottom of the picture would be white(undeveloped). Sometimes we would wait only to have a blank zink sheet emerge. Many times nothing at all. Frustration and time spent opening and reloading blank sheets is how we dealt with it. At one point at top of Lombard in San Fran the back came off and the spring loaded actuator came apart. It was fixable but who wants to spend their vacation fixing junk. " 
 "What a great gift idea!. I got this for my daughter as a \x93Gift from Santa?and boy did the big guy deliver. My initial thought was this camera was gonna be pretty crappy and fall apart after one use. I could not have been more wrong. My family went to Disneyworld right after getting this camera. My daughter (7-year old) was able to take pictures easily and the photo produced within 15-20 seconds was of good quality. I was also able to take pictures of the family with Disney Characters and place them in her photo album which worked out perfectly. This is an inexpensive gift that has great upside. Santa did a good job picking out this gift lol! " 
 "Nostalgic But More Annoying Than Fun. I bought this for my youngest son who is an old soul.  It was more complicated than it should be and we wasted all the film it came with but one.It is fine but it takes a long time to print the film.  The quality is fine leaning toward poor quality.I remember it being so much easier back in the day.  I would avoid this product and maybe stick to buying just Polaroid products. "  "It\x92s just fine? For someone who doesn\x92t care how the picture turns out it\x92s a great and cute gift. For those who want a decent photo?this is probably not what you should get. The colors either come out too warm or black it\x92s easily blurred and the view finder does not always work so 1/2 the picture is sometimes cut off. Great idea not the best execution " 
 "I really expected more from Kodak.. Camera is hot garbage. My opinion as a photographer and a mom. My sons first \ "real\ " camera was NOT a hit. Its glitchy feels like cheapo plastic. Do the ins*** brand instead. This one is terrible. "  "Wish this had a window for how many pictures are left. This camera was easy to set up easy to charge easy to fill with paper for pictures and easy to use.  My only gripe is that you don\x92t know when the last picture will be.  I have taken many photos only to find out at my dismay that there is no more paper in it for printing.  There should really be a window that displays the number of pictures left per stack of paper put in. " 
 "Image quality was a letdown but it's ok for a kid.. The picture quality is not at all like the ad images show. Not even close. Even if we hold the camera super still and have the best natural lighting. Also it says it included a charging cord but there was no cord included at all. But it takes a basic cord like an android phone takes so not a huge deal. It's ok for a kid- I bought it for my teen. But if you want something a bit clearer and better quality try something else. It was a bit of a letdown. " 
 "Just okay.. Purchased for a project that requires a printed photograph each day for several days.  Would not recommend unless you need for a similar situation.  Picture quality is poor.  Very tricky to figure out best lighting and distance situations.  Works best with natural light in a bright yet cloudy environment.  Sunny situations cause harsh shadows yet the camera requires sufficient lighting.  Like other reviewers mentioned it is extremely easy to accidentally hit the sensitive shutter button and print an unwanted image.  It has happened to me twice even after being extra cautious.Additionally it does not keep track of how many shots are left so you must be prepared with extra paper.  The manual says it stores photos that are taken after paper runs out and automatically prints them when the new paper is inserted but that was not the case with my camera. " 
 "Eh. We ordered 2. One works great the other doesn\x92t keep a charge long enough to take a photo. The photo quality is rough like don\x92t breathe and have a tripod bc it\x92s gonna be blurry rough. I do like that the photos are stickers because my kids are obsessed with stickers. I don\x92t think it\x92s worth $50 plus more for film at all. My kids love it though. "  "Terrible photo quality.. This camera takes awful photos. Everything comes out with a pink haze over it. Every photo is blurry. The photo I attached was the best one it took. For the price I would expect more. Definitely pay $50 more and just get a real Polaroid camera or something that takes quality photos. What a bummer. Also doesn\x92t have the black and white option and comes with no charger. " 
 "A Very High Cool Factor. Super easy to use. Prints perfectly acceptable instant pics in a little less than a minute. If you're looking for very high quality pics this may not be for you but if you think low cost instant pics that are stickers is pretty cool you'll love it. I bought one for my friends birthday and was so impressed with the cool factor that I bought another for myself. The digital pics that save to the SD card are 2.5 MB so on a 32 GB SD card you can save over 1200 pics. Pretty neat! " 
 "I thought it would be better.. The camera is made kind of cheaply. I bought this for my 9yr old son and hes already done something to it that it won't close back all the way when replacing the film. Plus the pictures are not that great of quality. Like there's a flash when it's not needed and it makes the pictures look awful. Compared to a Instamax camera (I think that's what its called) which I have one for my daughter.. the Instamax is better quality all around. Durability and better picture quality. Sorry I hate to leave bad reviews:( bc everything is just made so cheap anymore and its most likely not the sellers fault for the quality.. so I apologize. I still need to tell the truth for the next buyer though. " 
 "Do not buy!. I love film photography and I think instant film cameras are awesome and I thought this one would be really nice and fun. But once I opened it and loaded the film I could never get the back to close...this affected the picture quality making every picture I took have vertical lines all across the picture. Also I was only able to take 3 pictures with the camera. Almost every time I tried to take a picture the film would get stuck and sound like it was developing the picture but the camera wouldn't do anything. I looked up what to do when the film gets stuck and I learned than turning the camera on and off would do the trick to get the film to develop. I tried this and it took the camera almost 2 minutes to turn off but when I turned it on the film didn't develop ......the film just stayed in the camera. It didn't develop ....it didn't do anything. I finally had to shut off the camera and pull the film out. DO NOT BUY!!!! IT WILL BE A BIG DISAPOIINTMENT!!! " 
 "Cute enough and easy for my 10yr old to use on her trip. So I only gave it 3 stars because although it was a part of xmas gift for my daughter before she left to travel and she loved it and it was simple enough for her to use it DID NOT come with the case that it says it does. That was disappointing because I didn't get the option to just get the case that was missing. Because she was traveling  the next day I couldn't return it just to get another package with the case inside. I had to run to retail store and ended up spending more money on a separate handbag that was small enough for her to carry the camera in. " 
 "Don't even try it. I wish I was one of the lucky ones to get a good working camera! Nope. I saw the negative reviews and went for it anyway it took ONE picture. Only one and then it stopped working entirely it would sit there and try to crank out the photos but nothing would come out or print. Returning it within 5 minutes of it being delivered. This is absolutely not worth the $50 don't even bother with this one. "  "Glad I ordered. The media could not be loaded.\n                \n            \n                \n            \n        \n    \n    \n\n  \xa0I\x92m really happy I got this me and my family had a lot of fun taking pictures. It is so easy to use. " 
 "Very meh. Photo quality was terrible and overly red. Everyone who used it found it hard to figure out the cropping and kept accidentally snapping photos that would then waste the paper. Reloading the photo paper a spring popped out of the camera and rather than fixing it I just threw it away and gave away my additional paper packs. Total waste. "  "Just okay. I was looking for a new Polaroid that resembled the old ones.  I thought this might be it.  But the pictures are blurry and washed out.  Not at all crisp and clear.  And they're very small--more like a Monopoly card than a photo.  My 9-year old grandson still thinks it's great fun to take pictures and get them almost instantly.  He's happy but he doesn't know about how the old ones were.  As for me I'm a bit disappointed. " 
 "Not worth it. This camera is not good at all. Pictures do not come out as the images show. They are blurry as discolored no matter what I try to do. You also have to sit completely still in order for anything to work out. I would not suggest anyone buy this. "  "Total waste of money. I didn't expect much from this camera but wanted something that would be fun for my son. This is AWFUL! Pictures are blurry no matter how still you hold it. It's very slow so you think you didn't take a picture and push it again. Then it prints everything that was taken when you thought it wasn't working. So annoying and bad product " 
 "Looks Nothing Like the Viewfinder. The photo quality is horrible.  The facial features of my cat did not show up at all (see photo).  If you frame a shot in the viewfinder the photo looks nothing like it. I took a photo of my dog that cut his nose and feet off.  I only took two photos with it because it was so terrible.  Definitely not like a Polaroid! "  "Terrible Photos (I mean TERRIBLE)!!!. This is by far the worst camera I have ever purchased. I get it it\x92s cheap quick photos but by god is the quality bad. My camera came missing the charging cable so I couldn\x92t use it right away. After hunting down a comparable cord at a local store I waited 2 hours for  it to charge for it to not even spit out the photos. After another 2 hours of frustration I finally got it to work and the photo quality was so bad I thought maybe I just had some bad photo paper. So I order a new pack wait 5 days to receive it  and BOOM out comes another terrible photo. I read the reviews in this camera and quickly learned that I was not the only one who was having bad quality turns out this camera is kinda known for that so jokes on me for not reading the reviews. Good news is my little sister purchased a instant photo camera for half the price from a different brand that has amazing quality so I will just share hers. " 
 "TERRIBLE - buy another cheap camera bc this one isn\x92t worth it.. Worst camera ever. Couldn\x92t center my picture after many attempts at different methods. The quality is terrible. Granted you get what you pay for this isn\x92t even worth that. The worst part is that they don\x92t accept returns. Fortunately i was able to have the total refunded to me by Amazon. But again don\x92t buy this. Lol. Seriously. Just don\x92t. "  "Didn\x92t even work once!. I was so excited for my 9 year old to get this and it won\x92t even print. You can only put in 1 piece of paper in at a time and it won\x92t print the photo. When you take the picture it processes out and is a blank piece of photo paper!  And there was no charging cord with it. Would not recommend it nor would I buy it  again ! " 
 "Junk. Hoped to use this camera to take snapshots at an outdoor party that we could share with friends on the spot. But the picture quality is truly horrible in almost every way -- not nearly as good as the cheap Polaroid cameras that I grew up with in the '70s and '80s. It is difficult to understand why anyone would try to sell something this bad when we're all accustomed to clear and sharp point-and-shoot snapshots from our cameras.  We returned it. "  "This product is pure junk. I used this for the first time with children in Cuba who were very excited to see themselves photographed. It worked ONCE and then refused to produce photos at all.  It disappointed the kids and embarrassed me. I sent the entire package back for a refund because it is a useless product that does not work. " 
 "Disappointed. I rarely write reviews but I am really disappointed in this camera.  I bought it specifically to document my extensive pottery collection.  I wanted the small pictures that I could stick on the paper documentation in a binder.  But the picture quality is horrible!  With the flash the picture is totally washed out.  But with any kind of lighting it is also washed out.  And the frame in the viewfinder does not line up with what the camera actually takes a picture of.  So you end up having to guestimate where to place the viewfinder.  I wasted several sheets of photo paper trying to get decent pictures!  I would recommend something else. " 
 "Cool Gift for Teens. My daughter got this from Santa. She was so excited to use it. However you have to charge first for like 5 hours and it didn't come with a charger cord. "  "No charger. I thought that the camera was great but one thing I  did not like about the camera was that it did not come with a charger. I am wondering if the camera isn\x92t supposed to come with a charger or if it is? The instruction manual says it should. Overall I like this camera but I think they should come with chargers. " 
 "Nice camera!. I bought this for my son who is pretty young still. He kept telling me that all he wanted for Christmas was a camera that printed out pictures. Because of his age I chose this one because it was more affordable than other ones the paper was cheaper and it was simple. I\x92m very glad with my choice it\x92s everything I thought and then some. Good quality prints too! "  "Good?but didn\x92t last long. Loved this camera. Bought it for my wedding so we could fill the guestbook with pictures of our guests. The camera didn\x92t make it through the whole night now the power button is internally broken and won\x92t turn on. The button is more recessed than normal. I had my siblings on camera duty so it stayed on the whole time. Unfortunate i liked the camera otherwise! " 
 "Stopped Printing After Two Days. Bought this for my daughter's birthday.  She used it for two days set it aside and when she returned to it a few days later it would no longer print. The zink paper still comes out of the camera when you take a picture but there is no ink.  And yes I made sure she had the paper right-side up.  I wouldn't buy it again.  I can't return it because I purchased it mid-December. "  "Picture prints aren't very clear quality.. Like the look an bought the bundle pack that looks of good quality. However the picture prints are not of good clear quality considering it's a kodack thought would be good prints. Paid alot too. Comes out with a hazy tiny of slight yellow color in back ground. Considering a return. " 
 "Great Camera but charger not included. Amazon customer service was amazing!. If you purchase this camera BE SURE TO BUY A CHARGER SEPARATELY! It is NOT included which can catch you by surprise if this is a gift. Kids WILL want to use right away. Amazon customer service was first rate when I called to provide feedback. Once I can track down the correct charger\x85product review TBD. It\x92s very pretty though! "  "picture quality is terrible. We got this for my daughter and it prints very \ "orange toned\ " photos. I ordered new film thinking that was it. No change. Am not happy with it at all and grateful for Amazon as they are sending a replacement.  Hoping this one is a lemon.  We'll see...I'll update as needed.**update**We just got our replacement camera and it's just as bad.  Also you must know that it doesn't come with a charger. " 
 "not what it seemed. looks very nice and thats all. there is no instructions why it needs to reset but it shows you can reset ??? no usb cable included and most difficult to open the back to insert film. the back cover can not closed properly after open. picture are not clear. I am giving it last try on Kodak step will see .. "  "Print Only. Pros: instant prints peal-and-stick photos photo paper easy to loadCons: print only (can't just save to a memory card) no digital viewer muddy color small printsPurchased for my daughter (age 10). Expensive prints and each photo MUST be printed and tries to print even if out of paper.  Would have liked to see a save all to memory and choose which to print. Very much in the old Polaroid OneStep from the 70's 80's but much slower (and batteries not included in film pack. " 
 "Not bad for the price. Bought this camera for my 10-year-old son for Christmas and while it does take pretty good pictures they\x92re not perfectly clear like a regular Polaroid would be but for a 10 year old it\x92s fine also didn\x92t come with a charging cord like it said it does so I had to buy one separately. "  "Don\x92t wast your money.. The picture quality is terrible. If you can find just the right lighting they turn out vintage looking but the majority of our pictures just turned out dark. Very dissatisfied with this camera especially considering the cost of the camera AND the film. Returning. " 
 "Compact for travel. I bought this for my 10 yr old daughter for her summer trip with grandma. It was easy to show her how to use and reload the file. No batteries needed. She enjoyed it mostly; because she could take a quick picture of something she enjoyed. Then stick the pictures where she wanted (each Polaroid has a \ "peel away\ " back portion). To conclude even after it being dropped a couple of times this camera held up. 3 stars is because the pictures don't come out clear unless you have outside lighting. If you take the pictures indoors don't expect a clear shot. " 
 "Don't Even Bother. Bought this as a great idea for a wedding......to take pictures of the events over the long weekend and then string them up to show all the guests the day after. It came with 10 printer sheets and I bought a pack of 50 more--WHAT A WASTE! I dont even think I got 10-12 good...not great...not perfect...not clear pictures...Terrible!!! . It says to aim and take picture....well I did that time and time again and pictures were nowhere near centered...they were VERY blurry.....what a waste of money!! It says the flash light will come on when dark...that didn't happen either!!! Do not purchase this product.....I tried over 40 different times and wasted all that extra film for nothing!!!! " 
 "Terrible Photos. The camera is super cute but the photos are of very awful quality. Fuzzy and miscolored - attempted to recalibrate to no avail. Not recommending. "  "Love it.. Especially for the money this is such a great buy!! Once you kinda figure out the way it works (no flashy screens or Alexa to tell you what to do <U+0001F923>) it is super easy. Picture quality isn't incredible but if you're looking for that sort of faded Polaroid feel then this is great!! Photos are small smaller than a credit card but for me that's fine. Does black and white or color which is super cool. It's not to heavy. And yeah the photos have an adhesive back which is cute!! Great for a gift or some not-so-serious photography for a scrapbook. :) and it's fun to use! " 
 "Either my camera was defective along with the 6 packs of film I bought too. I thought the camera was adorable & great for me and my 10 yr old to share. Also very good for the price however I am an experienced photographer and either the camera was defective or the 6 packages of film that I bought too we're defective as well. I had to return it. Every single picture came out so blurry and the film constantly got jammed when it got down to the last few pictures. "  "Built-in goodness. Unlike with the other instant cameras wherein you'd need to worry about the holistic function of the product Printomatic has built-in lithium battery and built-flash to let you use your instant camera longer and efficiently. With the built-in flash I no longer have to worry about taking the images in a dim area. It prints out better-looking printed photos and gives more details to the whole image. I like that it has the auto-printing capacity too. It automatically prints out so no need to press a lot of buttons there to get a hold of your photos in hard copies. If I don't have a paper for it to print on it simply saves the images in microSD. I mean isn't it the coolest? " 
 "This is absolute junk.. We gave this gift to our son for Christmas and WHAT A MISTAKE. First off this camera came without the \x93included usb charger.?So after sifting through some old cords I found one compatible. Then after charging to full battery we pop the film in and wow- - - I didn\x92t know I would have to open the camera EACH AND EVERY TIME BETWEEN pics to fix the paper. After that fun exercise of watching my son look so disappointed with his gift he was sweet enough to say \x93not all Santa\x92s toys work right.?Nope neither do Kodak\x92s cameras.Please do yourself a favor and keep scrolling for another product. " 
 "Back Does not Stay on.. This is really really poorly constructed. The photo quality is meh- which is fine. This is more for fun. But- the plastic back falls off easily. We are using a series of rubber bands to hold it on. The Zink paper falls out and cannot feed without the back. It\x92s terrible! Buy a different brand. "  "NO CORD INCLUDED. Hey Kodak-I'm not trying to be difficult but if i pay upwards of $80 for a little print camera and film please do me the courtesy of including the charging cord!  especially if you're like me and on a ski vacation and didn't know this before you gave it to your spouse as a little gift.  I looked like a cheap-o hahahaha.  otherwise great camera-bought the lime green which is super fun! " 
 "Major difference among model. First of all this camera has two model. 2017 version and 2020 version. Although 2020 version may sound better it\x92s actually worse.I got 2020 version ( Amazon won\x92t let you choose) and it\x92s far off from how it advertises it.Firstly the quality is far off from how they market the product. All the pictures I\x92ve taken are low quality either all blurred up or all reddish color.Secondly this version has no black and white color switch  which shows that there\x92s a false advertisement.Lastly like I said before we do not get to choose which version we would get or would know which one it is getting shipped.Overall the camera itself is nice and cute but the quality does not match up to it. " 
 "My kids love it. Me not impressed. I was excited to give this to my 10 year old boy. He loves my Polaroid but the film is expensive. This camera feel light and cheap it doesn\x92t make a sound when you snap the picture. So your kinda waiting there like \x93ummm did it happen? Did it take it??Then it take about 30 seconds to start printing.The pictures are nice. You can\x92t control the flas and that frustrates me but the kids don\x92t notice that kind of stuff. They love it. I\x92m not impressed. I do like that the picture are stickers! " 
 "Took one picture...then...nothing but black prints. The poor quality of the product is evident by the feel of it upon taking it out of the box. It was given to my daughter as a present and we successfully took a single picture with it before every subsequent photo printing solid black. Clearly something wrong with the auto exposure. Followed the directions to a \ "T\ ". Already returned the item. I'd look elsewhere. "  "Great gift for tween but came missing charging cord. This was a Christmas gift for my daughter and she LOVES IT. The pictures from this camera are obviously not the highest quality but they are great for a tween/teen looking to capture moments with friends and decorate their space with photos. My only complaint is the charging cord for the camera was missing when she opened this Christmas morning. I should have returned it but luckily she also got a makeup mirror that uses the same type cord so we were able to get it working for her. Disappointed it didn\x92t come with what it should have and that her devices will have to share the cord. " 
 "KODAK DIGITAL PRINTOMATIC. THE PICTURES PRINT OUT VERY SLOWLY!!!  WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS CAMERA TO ANYONE. IT COMES WITH 5 PIECES OF PHOTO DIGITAL PAPER. WILL TRY THE PHOTOS IN THE DAY TIME AND OUTSIDE. I AM NOT THAT HAPPY WITH THE PHOTOS OF THE 1ST I TOOK. THE SIZE IS CUTE. ALL I CAN SIAY ABOUT THE PAPER. I THINK I SHOULD HAVE A BROUGHT A BETTER DIGITAL PRINT OUT CAMERA. "  "Are you serious?. Not at all what was advertised. Bought it for vacation pics but it never happened. 1 it only has a off button and the camera button. No switch for modes (which was advertised). I imagine the pictures would still be cute... If it ever printed! Contacted amazon and they did nothing. Said I should wait till after I return. I'm going to Walmart to get a new camera I'm going to stick with Walmart. " 
 "Pictures Come Out Discolored. I researched instant cameras and liked that this one can save the photos you take! I had a Fuji instant camera (photo on the left) and returned it for this one (photo on the right). As you can see it's a mess. Not sure why it comes out reddish and blurry. "  "pictures come out boyond poor quality. Do not buy this camera. Idea is great but design is not thought through. The button to take picture is located at the area that is easily pressed by accident. That way you waste way too much photo paper for no reason. The quality of picture of it self is beyond poor. Colors do not represent even nearly what they are in reality.Look for another brand. " 
 "Major disappointment!. I was very disappointed!  The SD card that was recommended (\x93most people who order this also order ...? was the wrong size.  This camera requires a mini SD card much smaller than the standard SD card that was recommended which I ordered.  The enclosed instructions were less than adequate.  We went online to find out how to load the film/paper.  Three of the four pictures that we took were unrecognizable but we couldn\x92t figure out why.  Only the first photo we took with photo paper in the camera was discernible.  The rest were just a blur ... but the instructions didn\x92t even address the issue of what could possibly cause poor picture quality.  I\x92m the Grandma and we were visiting from out of town.  I was really excited about this gift but it was a real letdown. " 
 "No charging cord available. I received my camera and was looking for a cord and I did not see one. I am in need of a charger in order to properly charge the camera. Dear company please provide me with proper resource on how to obtain a cord charger for this camera.  I also tried using other cords I have at home  but none of them are compatible.  Signed Unhappy costumer . "  "The printer Is not working. The media could not be loaded.\n                \n            \n                \n            \n        \n    \n    \n\n  \xa0After we print with the test photo papers that bring the camera the camera doesn't print the pictures as same as the print area that se took the picture.

Sometimes the light indicator Is blinking red and doesn't print. " 
 "very poor quality pictures. Yes this camera is cute though forget the 'gratification' element of instant gratification. The picture quality appears blurred to the point that you can't even see the important details of what you tried to capture no matter how still you hold the camera. A picture of a face will result in blurred black blobs for eyes even without mascara! So if you want instantly blurry pictures this is your device! "  "camera is good pictures not so much. The camera looks nice and beautiful (and giftable). The pictures were pretty bad quality. disappointed. " 
 "Didn't work. Going to return this because it doesn't work at all. It only beeps at us. My husband is a tech whiz build his own tech and everything. He could not figure out how to get it to work. We read every troubleshooting guide available. Nothing worked. "  "Polaroid camera. Order the camera can\x92t get it to print off pictures not sure how to use it properly read the instructions looked at the pictures date is it said and still camera does not print out photos print out the blue piece of paper that it says that it needs to have in there for color sheet but does not print out photo " 
 "Awesome and fun little camera. This is so much fun to use and it's great to have photos printed to give to friends. But a 1gb micro SD card (or smaller) since the battery life is minimal and you won't ever fill 1gb in a charge. Any larger micro SD is a waste of money. This is been my take-along camera since I got it and giving people printed photos has been appreciated by everyone. "  "Poor photo quality.  Overall bad camera.. Thought I did my homework before I bought this for a Christmas gift only to be mortified at the absolute garbage quality of the printed photos on the big day.  Yikes!  Literally processed return of this on Christmas Day & bought a replacement Instax.First the \x93switch?to allow users to flip between color and B&W images has been removed from the camera & the device is now color only.Second there is no way to adjust image quality for color balance & the photos come out as almost totally red-toned & are unusable.Third can\x92t turn on/off flash. It\x92s automatic & doesn\x92t work went it should.Finally the back cover for the film is poorly fitted & doesn\x92t attach well.Avoid!!! " 
 "Not a great product. First of all the camera does not come with a charger. It will work with a Samsung tablet charger if you have a spare. Second the picture quality is not good at all. We have tried with little light and extra light and pictures come out with flash lines. There is no option to turn flash off. I would not recommend this camera. "  "Waste of money. Even from the first picture taken the camera did not work as advertised. At first the picture came out blurry then the flash stopped working and now when pictures are taken it is off center and a white strip is left on the right side of the photo. Less than 15 total photos have been taken with the camera. A complete waste of time and money. " 
 "Really poor pictures. Honestly I have to say I\x92m very very disappointed. I got these as gifts for my kids for Christmas. Well buyer beware because the pictures in the listing are not what you\x92ll get. Even subjects that are totally still come out poor and blurry. I have a Zink printer as well and that picture quality is much better than this so it really is the camera. I bought 2 total and I\x92m disappointed by both. Cannot recommend them at all. "  "Disappointed. I have had a lot of problems with this camera.  I have dealt with: a 5 min charge after charging for over an hour a duplicate photo coming out after snapping once photos not coming out at all having to reload the film because it refused to feed through and my kids fingers in a few shots.  I bought this for them and it has been a nightmare.  We wanted to do an art project and it has now taken almost a week of attempts to get it finished. " 
 "Jams to the point of not worth trying to fix anymore. Bought this camera for my son to be able to take pictures for fun. We never got it to work properly. The photo paper jams almost immediately every time and no matter what I do to fix the problem and I have done everything research has told me to do the paper gets stuck every time and doesn\x92t print. Wish I returned for a refund but it was a gift and had to wait to be given. Won\x92t be using or recommending. "  "Nice try Kodak.. While despite instant photo abilities via cell phones one must download and print which can be time consuming. This little simple point and shoot camera from Kodak delivers photos in seconds without need of s separate printer.The down side is that the pictures are small  The same concept in a larger format has merit for one shot -no copy photography would be better.  . " 
 "AVOID! Huge waste of money. Awful. This camera 1st doesn't align prints properly 2nd prints washed out very red colors and 3rd is so blurry you can't always tell what it's a picture of.  I confirmed that it just does that. I set it down to snap a pic to make sure I wasn't accidently moving it around. DO NOT BUY! "  "lovely camera but battery isn't the greatest and prints got jammed .... I got this instant camera for an upcoming trip but unfortunately did not get to use it for the trip. ):Upon first initial receive I loved the camera. The color and design was great and it was such a simple camera to use. And the prints that came was quite decent.However as I continued to test out the camera while I was in the middle of taking a photo the print did not come out because it got stuck due to the battery being low. Strange since I charged it the day before to full battery and didn\x92t use it.Alright so I charged it full again and turned it back on hoping that the previous photo I took would print but to no such luck. Snapped another photo thinking it would make the stuck photo come out but nope. I tried to un jam it but it remained stuck. Didn\x92t want to do anything else to it as I was afraid I would break it at that point.I didn\x92t have time to go get it looked at as my trip was the very next day. Overall just disappointed that I didn\x92t get to use it for my trip as I\x92m sure it could have taken some lovely prints. " 
 "Do not buy. Worst pictures ever printed prints three at a time total waste of money film and time. Not one picture turned out.Sad part is my daughter used her Christmas gift card to buy this for herself and this is the result. I should have read the reviews before telling her go ahead. "  "Decent. Photos are passable. You need excellent light and very steady hands otherwise they\x92re blurry. We bought one for our daughter and it\x92s been challenging. She likes it but I feel like she has to work around the shortcomings more than she should. I think a Fuji Instax might be a better option for a kid. " 
 "Decent Buy. My daughter really wanted this camera so I bought it for her. It\x92s definitely cute and convenient but the picture quality is not clear. Tried reading up on it to make it clearer but it\x92s a yellowish background it prints out. If we can get that clear then it would be great. "  "Instant Print Camera. Unfortunately I was disappointed in the camera. The first few pictures turned out good. After reloading the camera a couple of times I couldn\x92t get the back to snap into the closed positions. Several people tried to get it snapped together. Even holding it tight pictures didn\x92t turn out at all. In defense of Kodak I never asked for a refund or a replacement. " 
 "Fun - But Not Intuitive. I bought this camera in order to allow guests at a birthday party to take snapshots to stick into a guest book along with a written message. It worked OKAY.The camera doesn't work particularly well in low-light situations. Many of the photographs came out grainy as a result. The lights on the camera are somewhat non-intuitive and many guests weren't sure whether they were properly taking a picture or not. The battery also seemed to drain somewhat quickly.The printed photos were of okay quality - saving them to an SD Card did produce somewhat better digital versions than I had expected given the printed quality. Occasionally a photo would be completely gray and we never did figure out why.It mostly did the job and I didn't expect the photos to be gallery quality though so it mostly met my expectations. " 
 "No charging cord included. I ordered 2 of these cameras for family members for Christmas.  When they opened the packages neither one of them had a charging cord in the package (in which it plainly stated on the package that there was one included).  I tried to reach the warranty but they have a waiting time that will take up the rest of my day!! "  "Missing main ingredient..?!?. Came with no charger but says it is included?!?! Eventually found a compatible charger but for the price should have all parts in the box. Put a damper on a birthday boys excitement. ....Nice Camera and pics. though. " 
 "It\x92s good if your lighting is good. It works pretty easy to load the paper and use it\x92s just your lighting needs to be good to get a good clear photo. Even though it has flash it still comes out dark if lighting is not bright enough. I would say if you can afford the more expensive ones go for it. "  "Great and fun Instant camera. This is a real and great instant camera quality is great pretty easy to use  and it works as expected  it is an Instant camera so just push and print it was what I was looking for  I \x91ve been working on a project so I kind of add it some accesories to the camera to make it work with a step down ring to add some cool filters and be able to put a cap on it so in case that the camera it\x92s on and I pushed the shooting button by mistake the camera won\x92t trigger the printer so I save zink paper XD " 
 "Something isn\x92t right. Something isn\x92t right about my camera. None of cameras on the videos I\x92ve looked at look like mine. It\x92s missing the color/black&white option and it doesn\x92t have the three lights on the back left hand corner that indicate the battery life/photo paper. The picture quality is trash too. None of my pictures look good at all and it says there\x92s an automatic flash but I have yet to see a flash go off. "  "Nothing but Blur. Doesn't work unless you're 6 inches away from your subject. I bought this for a work event to give kids a fun keepsake-complete waste of money and return window of course closed 4 days before the event. Also the film is nearly impossible to buy-only available online and can't get it quickly. " 
 "Leaves much to be desired. Picture quality leaves much to be desired. Have also used a rechargeable instax camera and definitely prefer it over this one. Wish I would have gotten the instax for my daughter instead. Fun for a little kid but cannot have any hint of movement or the photo is blurry. Also the coloring is pretty yellowy. "  "Good photo quality & Lightweight. I really like this and prefer it to my instax mini 9. The photo quality is a lot better and you won\x92t be wasting photos that may come out too dark like with the instax. The only thing  I don\x92t like as much is that the film is loose and not in a cartridge but it\x92s still easy to install.I would definitely recommend this over the instax. " 
 "No charging cable!. I\x92ve ordered this for my child. It looks very cute and light and handy. The picture quality is alright for kids or fun purposes. I would recommend it.JUST it doesn\x92t come with charging cable!!! Misleading info in description. Plz be aware of it. "  "PRINTS JAMMED UP WITH A COUPLE OF PRINTS. I purchased this camera before Christmas and at first it worked well. The camera started jamming and i couldn't retrieve the photos. I purchased 20 more prints for it but I couldn't use them because of the jam. I tried to pull the photos out but there was no hope. I just returned this to the sender for my refund. The quality of the photos were not good at all. I wanted the same quality of prints like in my childhood. No good " 
 "I did not receive what was advertised.. I did not receive the b&w vs color toggle switch at the top nor does my camera have the three lights at the bottom left. I already put stickers on the front so I don\x92t think I can return it I didn\x92t realize until after I wanted to try out the b&w feature. Other than this the sticker backing and not having to wait for the photos to develop is cool. The picture quality isn\x92t the best but it\x92s a fun affordable light weight and easy to use camera. Still didn\x92t get what I thought I was going to though <U+0001F44E> I should have bought from a different store. " 
 "Worst Camera Ever!. Bought it for my wedding guest book and out of nowhere the pictures where coming out not centralized with a big white back on the end.VERY LOW QUALITY!!!! "  "Terrible - don't purchase!. I should have followed the recommendation of the reviews and avoided purchasing this camera. The camera produces poor color quality photos and it is impossible to center although the guide square is followed.I purchased this to test it out to see if it can be used for the young students but the quality is terrible. I'm disappointed Kodak would produce such a low grade camera. " 
 "Get A Polaroid!. I thought this would be an upgrade on the Polaroid cameras but am returning 2 days after she opened for Xmas. We have been charging for 2 days the the POS still won't print a picture. Super disappointed. "  "Good fun camera for the price. This is a great camera for birthday parties holiday events and any other thing that you just wanted to capture with a photo. The picture quality is good I would not say great but it's definitely worth the money. The only problem is that you accidentally take two pictures at once if you're not careful because the button is too easy to push. In other words you waste film that doesn't come by very cheap " 
 "Parallax Issue. This is a great package overall.  The camera takes good pictures.  But there was significant parallax issues between what was in the view finder and what printed out.  I'm an amateur photographer with 40 years of experience and I'm familiar with the discrepancy when using a view finder.  This camera's view finder has problems even on distant subjects. "  "Unable to figure out for my 11 9 and 5 year old. Waste of money. I was so excited to get these for my 4 boys. I had 3 adults read the poor directions and  watched the help videos. Only could get it to work for one photo which had a light glare in it. It is either way more complicated and not appropriate for children or a waste of money. We attempted multiple times. My kids were so disappointed. " 
 "Fun!! But breaks too soon. Very fun! But only lasted a day. On the third round of film (10 pics each) it started spitting out every single page after the first picture and wouldn\x92t stop. I couldn\x92t even turn the power button off. Weird. Great idea though. Had fun while it lasted. But not worth the price for one day. Really wish it still worked. "  "Horrible. Do not waste your money. I can\x92t believe they\x92d even sell such a piece of crap. We tried taking pictures in all kinds of light and all of them came out bad. Pictures were blurry color was off. You snap the picture but it\x92s unclear whether or not it actually took. It takes several seconds to start making any kind of noise to let you know if the picture actually took. They don\x92t even include a USB cable with the camera so you can charge it. You have to purchase that separately. It\x92s a horrible product. " 
 "Easy to use Fun Higher quality images than expected. Super Simple to use easy to load easy to point and click Better than expected picture quality. We set the Camera down while it prints and the prints are very clear. Bought and used this for a big family birthday party and it was extremely fun to have instant memories put up at the party that people could take with them. "  "Kid-proof photos. Got me some durable photos to keep the memories alive for years to come all thanks to Printomatic. I've got kids and they're mostly the subject of the images I take. But 90% if the time they are eager to look at their printed images with filthy hands or soaking wet especially when we're at the backyard and they're having fun in their inflatable pool. Had I been using normal cameras with cheap papers I would have lost those precious photos already due to my kids. But because I was using Printomatic I get water-resistant printed images. Oh and my two-year-old's destroyer little hands won't rip the paper apart too. I'm beyond pleased. " 
 "Avoid. Way too finicky of an item. The battery doesn\x92t last prints very slow horrible picture quality. "  "Christmas Gift. Bought for my daughter for Christmas (2020) so we haven't tested it yet didn't realize it didn't come with a USB to charge it <U+0001F644> thankfully I have plenty around the house. Will update once she uses it comes with a small pack of print paper. Glad I bought extra. Overall it's cute and small. "  "Poor quality photos. I got this camera for my 6 year old. It is easy enough to hold and operate. However the resulting pictures are of low quality. One issue is the camera has to be held perfectly still for~2 seconds after hitting button or the picture is a complete blur. Even holding it still the printed pictures are pretty low quality. I wouldn't recommend this camera. " 
 "Go with the Polaroid. No where in the instructions does it tell you to put the paper in face up but it sure does tell me how to take a selfie.  First time my daughter pressed the pic button the paper is jammed in the camera and we can\x92t get it out.  There is no reverse feature or a way to open it up like a printer.  Overall we are very upset that \x93Santa?gave this to her.  We should have gotten the Polaroid "  "The camera worked sometimes then did not work.. The camera was a Christmas Gift for my Granddaughter. What a disappointment! The instructions were inadequate. When I finally figured it out I got 2 photos then none. I changed the paper. I took out the paper that came with the camera. I put in a brand new pack of very expensive kodak paper. I got one picture. Our grandchild took 3 pictures then it stopped working. We reset the camera. We turned it off then on again. Nothing would make it print. She didn't want anything to do with it. I am sending it back. " 
 "Fragile camera beware. Pictures are horrible most of the time.  Film pops out of the camera because the latch is so easily opened by any force. I HAVE TO PUT TAPE ON THE back so I don't lose film...  order tape when you order this. This technology has been out for years it should be better. "  "Picture quality. I\x92ve taken 20 to 30 pictures with this camera so far all of them seem to have a red tent and just look very poor quality compared to other cameras like these that I\x92ve used. You have to make sure you hold the camera perfectly still so that the pictures don\x92t come out blurry. Pretty disappointed with how much money it was. " 
 "Functionally flawed. I\x92d pick zero stars if I could. I\x92d have given it 4.5 for being simple to use retro-looking and compact: but there\x92s one glaring problem: you can\x92t turn off the printer!! You take three pictures it starts printing after the first and then the thing shuts down photo mode and just prints after the third. Whether or not there\x92s paper in it! Absolute functional failure. Failure. Besides that it\x92s great. I returned it immediately. "  "No charge cord. What kinda of product doesn't come with a source to charge it?!?!!?  This camera sucked!!!!It does say in the description that no USB cord is included but it doesn't say it's an unusual cord so you are going to have to order a cord.  I bought two for my grandkids at Christmas to take pictures and we couldn't. " 
 "Terrible Camera. Bought this as a Christmas gift it barley works and has ruined more film than it\x92s printed a photo on. Complete waste of money will be needing to purchase a new gift as this is more of a headache than it is fun to use. "  "Don't waste your money. I bought this for my Granddaughter because it's what she REALLY wanted for her birthday.  It comes with no charger but yet you have to charge it before you can use it.  So if you don't have a compatible charger laying around you're screwed.  The picture quality is horrible.  All of her pictures have turned out with a red tint.  The film is expensive and for the quality it's a waste of money. " 
 "LACKING. Honestly I use my Kodak Printomatic as a room decor than as a camera. Initially I gravitated to the sleek and minimalist design of the camera. However after my purchase my first impression of this camera did not last when I took my first photo. The camera quality was not impressive and it still is not. The shutter button is very sensitive to the slightest touch which can lead to an unwanted and wasted printout. Overall I would not recommend this product. "  "horrible camera and even worse printer. This takes so long to capture a frame that the pictures are sooooo blurry. Add that to the poor print quality and it's an awful product. I feel really bad that this was our \ "Santa\ " gift to our child. She can barely get one decent photo out and given the cost of the ZINK paper good lord. " 
 "Not up to my standards. Well it's like taking a selfie in the yr 2000. You can see the image you tried to capture but it's all blurry and it seems over exposed.  The colors are light.  The one cool thing is the pics are stickers! So you could make a scrap book of crappy picures. "  "Don't waste your money!. I'm not sure if I received a defective camera or of the quality is just horrible. The pictures come out very blurry and miscolored. I wasted about 5 pictures trying to figure out how to use the camera I wasn't sure if it was even taking a picture when pressing the button. Definitely returning and getting a regular Polaroid or Instax camera. " 
 "What the heck?. Why on earth would you sell a product that is rechargeable without a charging cord??? Not cool Kodak.  Other than that it would have been 4 stars. It\x92s cute the pics are fine and the self stick backs are perfect. "  "Very cool scrapbooks item. Great item. Similar to Polaroids.  Sticky back. Quality is alright but good enough for what's it's used for. Wish it had a digital screen before printing but other than that love it. "  "KODAK PRINTOMATIC - NO CHARGING CABLE INCLUDED!. Horror!  Purchased camera camera case and extra film.  Nowhere was it indicated that a charging cable was not included.  Had a very disappointed and confused Granddaughter on Christmas.  (Not to mention an embarrassed and disappointed Grandma!)  Therefore I am unable to evaluate the quality of this product EXCEPT to say that I expected more from a KODAK product.  Used Customer Service feature and they only said I could return the product for a refund.  That is impossible because my Granddaughter left with the camera.  We still have no idea how one is supposed to charge this thing.  Needless to say no \ "instant prints\ " for us. " 
 "This camera is a waste of money. I was so disappointed using this camera. The photos are awful. They are either completely washed out or totally blurry. I am an experienced picture taker and was looking for something instant and fun. This camera is not it.Don't your money or your time.PS I gave it one star because I can't give it no stars "  "More like the Kodak Trashomatic. I bought for a holiday gift for one of my children. It literally printed 3 photos and stopped working. Over the course of 4 days I tried every trouble shooting technique out there (there's like 2-3 techniques) to arrive at the conclusion of a very sad child with no gift. " 
 "Poor image quality. Purchased for my 7 year old. It works like a traditional polaroid - there is no preview of the photo before printing which means many photos are wasted. When you do get a good picture angle the image quality is poor. Over-all it's not worth the money in my opinion. "  "Disappointed. Very disappointed in this purchases. Pictures at always very blurry and print with lines through them. The back cover does not go on properly. With a name like Kodak I expected much more quality.  Waste of money. " 
 "Great Concept Terrible Item. This product inconsistently worked. It easily goes off if the table it is sitting on is knocked and then you end up with a photo of someone looking in horror at the realization that the incredibly expensive film was wasted. The camera flashes chirps and THEN snaps the picture. Good luck getting photos of kids because they run as soon as they hear the chirp. And that means- more wasted incredibly expensive film wasted. Save yourself the headache and do not buy this product. " 
 "Its eh ok. Image Resolution isn't as good as I expected - i thought it would be more like a polaroid. But my biggest complaint is theres no sound or notification that a photo was taken it just will print after a few seconds so kids take multiple photos not realizing. It came with a bunch of cute stuff though. "  "Camera only works properly ever so often. I'm not a fan because the film comes out at will.  Sometimes it works fine. Other times the film crumbles inside and you have to take it apart. Sometimes it will print the picture you tried to take before most recent one and then the next photo doesn't print at all. I wouldn't recommend it. " 
 "Good Camera; I may have a dud. Works well but I stopped being able to take photos on it about a month ago for some unknown reason. It flashes red. I\x92ve tried reloading the sticker paper charging it and a number of other solutions I found online. Nothing seems to work. It\x92s too bad I missed the return window because I think I got a dud. "  "Not Cute. Ugh we bought this for my daughter's birthday and it's small and cute and pink but the pictures are garbage. My son was given an instax some 5 years ago that still prints great. Don't recommend. " 
 "Poor quality. This was a Christmas gift that never worked. Fully charged makes all the sounds but the part that rolls the picture out doesn't work. "  "Do not buy. Absolutely terrible product. Not only are the pictures terrible quality but the camera does not function properly and cannot take a centered photo. I wish I hadn't thrown out the box Christmas day as I would absolutely return it. I chose this as an easy to use camera with instant reward for a 6yro. Extreme waste of money. "  "Not great. I wasn\x92t expecting the quality of the pictures to be great but the pictures come out with an orangey-yellowish distracting tint. Sometimes the pictures don\x92t even print completely even when allowing time in between shoots and printing time. I wouldn\x92t recommend it not even for a child. " 
 "Did Not Receive Charger/ not worth it. Camera did not come with USB charger..*update after few days of owning it*The camera is very cute however it started acting up after taking some pictures. Charged it until it\x92s good but It would make a sound like it is printing a picture then it would shut off . I tried to reset it 3 times but it didn\x92t help. The quality is not good either. Currently waiting for a refund. I wouldn\x92t recommend this product to anyone. "  "Crap. This camera was a gift for my daughter. We have been though three packages of film and all pictures are dark and blurry. " 
 "Frustrating buy. After working with this camera for about three months I have found it to be extremely fickle.  Sometimes it spits out blank or partially exposed photos.  Sometimes I do not get a picture at all even if it seems to have taken a photo.  I have also had it where I cannot take a picture even if the camera is on and seems to be ready.  I bought this camera for my seven-year-old daughter and really regret the purchase.  This may be a fine camera for someone who wants to take the time to learn its eccentricities but I myself would rather have a more straightforward camera for this application. " 
 "Printed picture. Poor picture quality!!!! Tried several different pictures and they all had an orange hue to all the pictures. Picture size was perfect. Bought this for my mother who is 97 and wants to take pictures of her family when they come to visit. Sent it back ordered a different camera. I was very disappointed with Kodak. "  "Nope. I did not like the quality of photos from this device. Ordered it as a Christmas gift for my daughter and was very disappointed. Easy to use easy to fill photo paper and I love the zink prints as I use it in my personal mini printer. This device was sent back for refund. Also DOES NOT INCLUDE CHARGING CORD! You need a micro usb to charge device which was not included. " 
 "Not the same model!. I bought two of these. One for me and one for my kiddo so that we could play together. What I received was NOT the same model as described and pictured in the listing. It appeared to be an earlier model. The back didn't have the same open-release it did NOT have a black and white option and basically was entirely different. I was so ticked that I returned mine but since the one for my kiddo was a gift we ended up keeping it. Not very happy about getting screwed over though. " 
 "Arrived broken Really disappointed. The camera came broken clicks as if it is taking the photo but will not dispense the film afterwards. Tried all the trouble shooting options from Kodak with no luck. Really disappointed. Called amazon with no help. "  "Returned two of these units for same printing problem.. I bought this camera as a Christmas present. After two days of use the printer jammed up. There is no way to clear the jam without taking disassembling the camera. I returned that unit and received a new one. The 2nd camera jammed and stopped working after the second picture was taken. I returned the unit for refund. I am happy with the service I received but the product is a poor product. " 
 "Picture quality not as advertised missing charger. Very convenient for what we use it for. It was missing the charger but luckily we have a ton of usb chargers around the house. The pictures on the box are obviously not from this camera. Picture quality not the greatest and not ideal for taking pictures of restless children or pets. Bought it to take quick family pics for our adventure challenge book. "  "Won't turn on!. Don't know how it works.. it won't turn on. I charged it up thinking that could be the problem but nope.. stinks! " 
 "Disappointing. I am a little disappointed with this product. I have a kodak step touch and I love it simply because I can print photos taken by my phone from the camera. I wasn't a fan of the actual camera quality but being able to instant print was a plus.I didnt realize that this product ( the printomatic.) did not feature a preview screen or the option to choose whether or not to print. I understand that you can insert an SD card but what good is that when you can't choose to print a certain photo from the camera itself?.I will be returning this product right away. " 
 "Good product minor issue. Great product! Bought more film packs for it. One thing I noticed though... first pic came out beautiful! Second one got jammed in printing & the rest of the film as a result for some reason came out slightly off blurry pics lighting strange. I can\x92t tell yet if it\x92s just because I had to take out the jammed pic and remove the film or if the camera is now faulty because the one jam. Will see after this film pack when new one comes! Besides that a good product! " 
 "Do not buy this!!!!. The picture quality is terrible. I got this for my nine-year-old daughter for Christmas and it will not take a picture that is not blurry. Even if she holds very still. This was a waste of my money and I even bought extra film and she\x92s already gone through it because most of the pictures are blurry. They should be easier for children to be able to take printable photos. Do not waste your money on this !!! "  "Crooked pictures!!!. Very disappointingly.  I would have been able to return this camera February 5th but apparently I missed the \x93return window?for prime.  I had not tried to use the camera until today and all pictures are crooked!!!! Disgusting you spend .50+cents per photo and they are all cutting out half of the left side of the picture! I did the whole setup correctly I know for sure. I had already previously purchased one for my parents and theirs is just fine. Now I have a useless camera and can\x92t return. Trash. " 
 "No paper. Bad picture quality.. Camera did not come with paper as it states. Very disappointed. The picture quality is also HORRIBLEI did not expect spectacular pictures but they are so bad. Unfortunately I couldn\x92t get it returned in time or I would have. "  "Return address for this camera and credit!. It broke after i( an adult) used it for the first time. I have attempted to return it so many times that is have contacted the BBB. All I want is  an address and refund. This has been going on since December !!!Why is this an issue when it seems returns with all other companies is seamless!!So disappointed as this was a Christmas gift and all I want to do is return it to the appropriate address and be refunded for the camera and warranty. WHAT IS THE ADDRESS!  I have waited 2 day( xs10+) and filed claims(xsm10+)Elizabeth Armenta " 
 "terrible pictures. This is my first time writing a product review but had to because the picture quality is that bad. I saw other reviews that said the quality wasn't great but I assumed these were picture people which I am not. I was just looking for something to take cute photos to send to friends. To be fair most of my test pictures were inside but even the outdoor ones weren't fantastic. The paper also got jammed on my second print but seemed to work fine after so far. I have had it less than 24 hours. " 
 "A poor rip-off of the Polaroid. Pass on this device. I purchased this as an alternative to a Polaroid camera my friend had. Her complaints were that the pictures paper were really expensive (double what the Kodak paper is) and it was very bulky to carry around.Enter Kodak Printomatic. We got it for a party and we took a few pictures.Meh. The average picture was VERY dark very low resolution and the time to print is absurd. You'll take a picture and wait a minute for it to come out.If you want a Polaroid style camera buy that. This is a waste. " 
 "Sold used camera when I purchased a brand new one. So far camera works good but it must have been used prior to my purchase because the camera did not come with a USB charging cable. Not happy I was sold a used camera when I thought it was brand new.  I\x92d be returning it and quite pissed if I hadn\x92t found a USB charging cable in my house that was compatible with the camera to charge it but it took too long to get here and I don\x92t want my kids waiting another week or more to get a replacement. " 
 "Disappointed. This is a cute idea and camera but poor quality and mine didn\x92t come with a charger! Amazon refused to send a charger or share Kodak\x92s info to get a charger. They wanted me to return or replace but we had already used the item. Photos are blurry and not color corrected even with the paper. Good for a small child gift but not good for any photos you want as a keepsake "  "It\x92s ok. Pictures do not come out as vibrant as it shows at all . Kinda disappointed thought the camera was cute but the pictures are like faded color . Nothing like it shows at allllll " 
 "NO Charging cable. The camera looks pretty good but since there is no charging cable I do not want to actually use it. I cannot figure out how to contact the seller so hopefully they get back to me. Otherwise I will most likely just return it as it should come with the charging cable. "  "Dissatisfied Customer. My camera didn\x92t come with a charger at all. I\x92m very dissatisfied. I ordered a charger and hopefully it fits. Haven\x92t had a chance to use the camera because I have no charger cable. I may end up returning it. " 
 "It's more for fun than for quality pictures. Which is what I wanted. Just a quick pic and stick it in my journal. You should buy more of the paper along with this it runs out pretty quick. the button is easy to press while holding the camera idly be careful not to waste camera ammo. pictures are grainy and look like school id pictures. "  "Junk. This camera looked perfect and for some reason is highly rated. It never actually worked. It made as many noises as it could but never produced a picture. What's more is it came without a charger that you have to buy separately which tells you that people just buy the camera a lot just because they need it replaced. It also had literally no directions. I thought point and press the button no pictures. It's just junk. " 
 "Mom will have a great honeymoon thanks Kodak. Mother's Day is approaching and I wanted to gift my mom early because she's heading to an exciting getaway for her honeymoon. I figured a camera would do since she's got a special place in her heart for polariods. And what better way to gift her for Mother's Day than a camera she can take with her to capture every sweet moment of her honeymoon. The best part she hated printing using the computer so I know that she will enjoy it the most. "  "not as it said. the color was not clear almost like out of focus. difficult to peel. if you are looking to use it in party just dont think its quick and easy. " 
 "NO USB CORD INCLUDED. I am so very disappointed in this product. I ordered it after Thanksgiving as a Christmas gift for my son. He opened it yesterday and was so excited!  Unfortunately it did NOT come with a charger (USB cord) and though we tried several other USB cords that we had lying around the house none of them worked. So my son can\x92t use the camera at all. I will be returning this and buying it elsewhere. "  "Neat little Device. Bought this for the Couple's date book because their camera was ~150 US dollars. This little camera came was a 1/3 of the price and film is widely available. This package will let us take a few more pictures for our book. " 
 "No usb cord. I want to say that we took pictures and everything was great but alas there was no usb cord and you need that to charge up the camera. More waiting because ordered separately.  Will do a follow up. "  "Great size Poor quality. I freaking loved how it fits in your pocket but the picture quality wasn\x92t so great could barely make out the picture and it was too sensitive to movement than most instant cameras "  "Stopped working after 4 pictures.. Worked for less than 15 minutes total. It seems like something is happening when the button is pressed and then it blinks red and nothing happens. Reset does nothing. Total garbage. Trust me and other reviewers. I made the mistake of ignoring them. " 
 "Not the best. I bought this for my daughter. She was excited but it did print blanks sometimes. It\x92s rechargeable but didn\x92t come with a charger. I wish it was a little better quality. The camera is light weight. Not impressed with it overall but it will work for now. "  "It's super fun and easy to use. Works as expected. It's super fun and easy to use. I do agree with another poster here that said the \ "click\ " button is way to easy to accidentally push and waste film however this isn't a deal breaker for me. The photos are not the BEST ever but exactly what I expected and I love them. Too fun to stick in my journal. Delivered quickly packaged well. " 
 "Don\x92t get it. Honestly wasn\x92t worth the money. I wouldn\x92t pay $20 for this. You have to remain impossibly still to get a poorly colored and out of focus photo. Don\x92t waste your money. "  "One picture before it stopped working and they don't accept returns.. Amazon eventually refunded the money but they initially said it wasn't returnable. It took one picture then it failed to feed the next blank picture. "  "Doesn't work.  Waste of money and poor customer service.. The back of this product would not close properly on day one.  Also would not line the pictures up appropriately.  When I tried to get my money back we had a near impossible time contacting anyone.  I was told I would get a refund by Amazon and then received an email stating that I would not get any money back because it was a \ "duplicate order\ " which made zero sense- it was not.  I still have not gotten our money back so consider it a complete waste of money. " 
 "Does not work. the feeder seems to be broken and none of the photos print in their entirety. A white stripe sometimes half of the paper remains and the photos are cut off "  "Worst purchase ever DO NOT BUY!!!!!. We purchased this camera for our 6th grade daughter to help journal her summer vacation. Half the time the camera will not print a picture or it tries to print every sheet in the camera. This camera is the worst thing ever. Very disappointed in our purchase. I did not expect super  high quality photos but I did expect it to work.  Would give zero stars if it would let me. " 
 "Fun little camera but picture quality isn\x92t amazing. It\x92s a fun camera that I purchased as a gift. The picture quality isn\x92t amazing but it\x92s fun to take some and use the sticker backs to place the photos. "  "Everything Is Orange Out Of Focus And Not Worth It!. I would not recommend this camera to anyone. I have not been able to take a single good picture with it. There is no flash almost every picture comes out of focus You cannot trust the picture target to center. the printer does not always work it doesn't come with any chargers. Everything is orange. I am really disappointed with this camera the novelty wore off after the first 10 pictures. " 
 "Not that great.. The pictures come out blurry if you\x92re not super still when you take it. My son is 8 and struggles to hold still. The photos that do come out clear are really poor quality :-/ idk I expected a better quality image I guess "  "MISSING PARTS. Get this gift for my god daughter - no charger - excited about her gift and missing part.  I call Amazon and get the \ "we will credit you $15.00 to order one\ ".  Which is great but have a very sad little girl.  So now we wait.  Just to bad that is the resolution vs additional compensation to keep the person happy extra paper to print....?? something.  The product is not bad itself just too bad. " 
 "Bad picture quality. Horrible pictures. I bought this for my 7 year old. She likes it but the picture quality is awful. Also the back doesn\x92t stay on correctly. Would not recommend. I gave it 2 stars as it\x92s easy to set up and use. "  "Disappointing all around.. We ordered this  for Christmas for our 8 year old and wow - what a disappointment. Every image is blurry there is not USB cable for charging and the black and white feature the camera is supposed to have is non existent. I question if this is truly a Kodak product? After reading some other reviews I am really regretting not having done more research before this purchase. Returning this. " 
 "Average Buy. This camera is for a kid between the ages of 7 and 12.  The quality of pictures is not what one would think.  When the pictures print I can barely make out who is in the pictures.  This product is not for an event or anything of the sort. "  "Absolute piece of JUNK.. First off if only comes with a \ "Quick Start Guide\ " and no actual user manual to tell you anything.Viewfinder does not line up with actual photos taken. In the included photos I took a photo of some jewelry on my desk and as you can see the jewelry is barely in the photo and the rest is all desk.The print is awful as well. Lots of banding and the color is way off as seen in the photo. Also left weird dots in the print every inch.Looks like I just bought a decoration for my shelf. " 
 "Dissatisfied. After I lost my Polaroid I settled to this only because of the sticker backing.Come to find out no place even carries those types of photo paper and the paper gets jammed in the process of spitting out the picture. So it only does damage to its self and other photo paper. Haven\x92t been able to use it since I bought it a year ago "  "Poor Picture Quality. We bought the camera for our very responsible (almost) 9 year old. The camera is easy to use but the picture quality is quite low for the year 2020. The quality is more what you would envision coming from an old flip phone. If she stands extremely still while taking the picture and for a second after taking the picture it turns out decent but still not great. We have also noticed the battery doesn\x92t seem to last long. It\x92s an okay beginner camera but not worth the price they are asking. " 
 "No screen on back. It\x92s an okay camera but there\x92s no preview screen on the back of the camera and it automatically prints every picture\x85even the ones you don\x92t want. "  "Awful Photo Quality. My Polaroid from the 80's took better quality photos than this. The pictures look awful. I wouldn't buy this again. The on/off button is also very sensitive. Keep that in mind if you put it in a pocket or purse. ThePolaroid Hi-Print is a far superior option. "  "Feeder stopped working in a month. The camera was barely used and it wont take photos anymore without having to open the back and push one print through at a time. Very cheaply made and hard to use for zooming in and picture quality " 
 "Not the camera shown. First off there was no USB cable as others have mentioned.  Second it does not match either the pictures on this page or the Kodak user manual I found online.  This site matches the user manual but the camera I got is neither.  It does not have a black&white switch it doesn't have a latch for the paper compartment it doesn't have a battery charge indicator. "  "Nope. Won\x92t hold a charge and has worked printing 1 picture.  Bought this for my kiddo for Christmas and doesn\x92t even work. Disappointed . Thought with Kodak name I was buying something of quality " 
 "Does not work very good pictures are awful. I return mine could not stand it pictures were awful it was the worst camera I've ever had total rip-off I returned mine I would not recommend this to anyone buyer beware "  "Had one small issue with the camera not printing a few of the pictures. It worked itself out but that was a bit frustrating. This is a fun little gadget though. The memory card is extra so that\x92s a bit of a bummer. But it has an old school nostalgia of not knowing what kind of a picture you\x92re going to get when you snap the photo so that\x92s fun. And I like the feature of being able to pick either color print or black n white. " 
 "Broke easily. Well we only got 10 pictures out of it before it broke. The picture quality was good and I bought it for my 8 year olds daughter. It was easy to use but changing the film was a bit precarious and that\x92s how it broke. I returned it and bout the Fuji Polaroid camera which was sturdier and easier to load. "  "Didn\x92t like it at all I wish I could have send it back. You literally need to stop breathing in order to get a picture usable. We\x92ve been using at least 20 film before being able to get 1 picture. Not good for selfie at all . Not worth the money " 
 "Does not work well in lower amounts of light. We have to take multiple pictures of the same thing before we get a halfway decent photo. Does not work well in lower amounts of light. The  button used to take a photo is extremely sensitive. We waste a lot of photo paper due to the photos coming out dark and accidental button pushes. "  "My 8 year old cousin loved it. It's an absolute winner as a gift to a little girl who loves taking pictures and sharing with her friends and family. Easy to set up and use. " 
 "Don't buy it.. Takes terrible pictures. Only one picture was good. My aunts 90 th birthday party and I only got one good picture. "  "Horrible picture quality. Camera is easy to use but that's about all it has going for it.  The picture quality on ours is pretty horrible but I think it might be defective.  The first picture it takes after it reads the calibration sheet is great but all the ones after it are REALLY BAD.  They have a purple cast to them and look like they were taken in the 50s.  Amazon is sending a replacement though and I ordered new paper to see if that might be the problem. If the new one is better I will update my review. " 
 "Not so good. I should have noticed it was a red flag whennit didnt even come with a charging cable when the instructions say it does. Quality is absolutely terrible. Took a couple test photos and each one is blurry beyond recognition. A couple of the pictures did not even print or it would take a picture of the wall after i set it down and not of the frame I took. I tried testing a few different methods of picture taking and nothing worked. Will be returning. "  "Instant photo quality is beyond garbage. I wanted to like this but the photo quality is so bad. Not sure how the marketing ads produce clear pictures but it is a straight up lie. I haven\x92t seen the digital copies via micro sd but the whole point of my purchase was for instant print photos and it\x92s total garbage. " 
 "Kind of junky. The picture quality is terrible but we got it for our son because he likes photos. Pretty junky camera. Don\x92t waste your money. "  "Don't bother.. Camera takes very poor quality pictures.  Even at low pixels it is so discolored it is not worth it. I was so excited for this camera the first one I got was broken from the start. All pictures came out as a purple fog. They replaced it and it worked for a little and is now also not working right. "  "Terrible Photos. This should have been a great camera for us to take pictures of our animals.  But the photos are terrible and crooked. AND ITS NOT ME! " 
 "NO Charger!!!!. Camera won't even work because it didn't come with a charging cord.  Will return if the company does not supply a cord.  No product should be sold without a power source unless it only needs standard batteries. "  "This is not going to print high quality photos. If you are looking for a polaroid- type camera with the quality of a polaroid photo and knowing you have to hold still like a statue for thus said photo then great this camera is great.If you want your photos to look like what they are advertising  use your phone. Buy something you can print your photos on to from your phone instead of this camera.3 stars no photo paper charging cord OR instructions were included. " 
 "READ THE REVIEWS. It doesn't come with a charger. The picture quality is something only a 10 year old would love. There is better stuff out there for maybe just 20 more bucks or so. PLEASE I am begging you to read the reviews. This camera is so bad. I'd return it if it wasn't a gift from \ "Santa\ " to my daughter and she thinks Santa doesn't do returns "  "Great camera!!!. I absolutely love this camera!  It's easy to use and I love that it prints the picture out right away.  It's great for scrapbooking!  The picture quality is decent but not fantastic and pictures are NOT water resistant. It only comes with a small pack of photo paper so it's best to buy some extra refills when purchasing this  camera. " 
 "Not worth it !. Was not worth the purchase. The quality of the photos I took were H O R R I B L E !  I repeat not worth it at all. I got it to use for a friendmas and yeah it didn\x92t go as plan. "  "very cheap and poorly made  trash  trash  could not even get it to take one picture  junk. never worked  tried everything  just real  junk  hopefully they send me the return papers they said they would  .. i doubt that will happen  ....  amazon  should take notice  this is junk "  "Disappointing color rendition and flash is useless.. Pictures are printed nicely but the captured image is not color corrected in any way for different ambient light conditions. " 
 "Cute and small.. Over priced. Like the size pics quality sucks and there is no flash "  "Okay. I got this camera for my daughter as a Christmas gift.  Honestly we were both excited about this camera just because it printed out pictures instantly. Although the camera seems pretty nice I have two issues with it.  It didn\x92t come with a charging cord and the picture results are not reflecting what we lined up inside the frame. "  "Not worth the money. It doesnt work. I bought this in June to give ti my grand daughter on her Birthday. It has been charged ready ti go and it didnt work. How disappointing for a young girl of 8 " 
 "Shipped as a Gift. As described Good price Prompt shipment.  Gift to Granddaughter no negative news on operation "  "Keeps falling apart!. The back that holds the picture keeps falling off. Definitely needs a latch I\x92m using tape. But overall disappointing. "  "Don\x92t buy it. <U+0001F937><U+0001F3FB><U+200D><U+2640><U+FE0F>. The camera itself is cute and takes decent pics as long as people stay still. But it goes off very easily so my daughter has wasted film. The reason for the 1 star review is because the tiny pieces that slide into the holes to keep the back piece attached is horrible! They are extremely flimsy and smash very easily. I keep having to fix them with a knife. If I had the box I\x92d return this. Sadly it got thrown out with the other Christmas trash. I\x92m very disappointed for the price. " 
 "Buyer Beware. I purchased 2 cameras from this same listing. 1 came as advertised but the other I received clearly stated on the box that it takes pictures up to 5 MP and it only prints in color. I also didn\x92t receive a USB cord. The other camera I received correctly takes pictures up to 10 MP and it has a switch for color or black and white photos. It also came with a USB cord. Just wanted to let others know that you might not receive the camera you think you\x92re ordering. "  "the view finder is off and the pictures are fuzzy. you have to like learn how the view finder is off and like aim away from what you actually want in the picture and sometimes it takes a few tries meanwhile it takes awhile for the photo to print so you have to remember where you aimed and then adjust <U+0001F92A>oh also the photos curl up if exposed to heat/humidity so keep them somewhere cool and dry. " 
 "A little advice. My grandson just loves photography and is even taking a class at our local community college. I thought this little camera printer combo would make a nice graduation present. Turns out I was right he just loves it. Grandma always gives the best gifts. You want to know why? It's because we pay attention to what our grandchildren talk about. A little advice for inattentive parents out there. "  "Best thang since the 90\x92s. The media could not be loaded.\n                \n            \n                \n            \n        \n    \n    \n\n  \xa0The picture quality is amazing different and I love it reminds me of when I was a kid. My kids loves it the most cause they can take the pictures and see it being printed. " 
 "easy to use. It is very easy to use just make sure that you load the paper into it the way that the picture shows because if you load it upside down it will not work. love it! I even bought one for my friend for her birthday and hopefully she'll like it as much as I do. "  "Defected item. I wish I had read the reviews like other ppl but I didn\x92t. This item was defected I gave this for a Xmas gift and how embarrassing. The printing of this camera didn\x92t work I had to return it. And wait more time to purchase another similar item <U+0001F44E><U+0001F3FC> " 
 "Picture quality of a $50 camera. This is a neat idea. Fun for kids I suppose. Picture quality is awful and you have to hold VERY still or you\x92ll get a blurry photo. Novelty at best. "  "Very poor and lifeless photos. The pictures produced by this camera were of such low quality and color that we couldn't justify holding onto it for longer than a few days. We tested it in high light low light and middling light with different types of colors and flash on/off and it was always disappointing. It only worked well outdoors under direct sunlight and even then they were satisfactory at best. " 
 "Disappointed. Not worth the money. Disappointing Christmas gift. Pictures come out blurry and off color. "  "Nice For Scrapbooking. Cute little camera. The picture quality is not great but I guess I shouldn\x92t have expected great photos. However more than adequate for my scrapbooking. I would purchase it again if only for the convenience of point shoot stick. "  "No worth it. After receiving a defective one we decided to give it another chance since my daughter really wanted it for Christmas. Unfortunately this is our second attempt at this camera and we still are unhappy the required film was used and yet it gets stuck very often. When it decides to actually print a photo it looks horrible blurry and coloration is off. I DONT SUGGEST THIS PRODUCT " 
 "Bundle missing hanging frames.. This bundle was missing the hanging frames.  I asked them to send me just the frames but was told I had to send EVERYTHING back as a replacement item.  6 days before Christmas I'm not sending the main item the camera back just for the picture frames.  OH well.  One grandchild will not get the frames. "  "not a big fan!. where do i start?i bought this camera to use for a photo guestbook but the quality of the pictures left so much to be desired.  maybe i'm just not used to instant camera quality but i expected more.  the biggest problem was the awkwardly huge button to take the picture...it was way to easy to accidentally take a picture as you picked up the camera.  the button should be recessed - total design flaw.sooooooo....this is going back!! " 
 "Fun but high maintenance. This is a lot of fun for kids especially printing the photos instantly to stickers.  But the cost and hassle of buying refills for it can get old really quick for the parents. "  "Cute camera. Got it as a high school graduation gift. She was happy to start using it right away. Fast shipping solid packaging true to product description "  "Very disappointed. Camera given to a 10 year old and when opened realized it has no charger. The instructions literally say to \x93connect the provided usb cable?very highly disappointed! " 
 "Amazing camera!. This is a great camera we used this for our guest book at our wedding. Paired with the sticky back photos these worked perfectly.Added bonus all the photos can be saved and uploaded to your computer. Nice to be able to print and send with our thank you notes! "  "Problems. I did have a problem with it printing some pictures. It would print some and it\x92d make the noise printing others but they eject printed. The picture quality was a little blurry but it was good for the money. It came with 10 prints which is AMAZING. " 
 "Not a good camera!!!. I got two of these plus a 50 pack of film for my kids Christmas gifts and I\x92m very disappointed!!! I thought maybe they just didn\x92t know how to use them but then I tried and the picture took was with every light turned on. We even turned every light off plus they didn\x92t come with the chargers when stating that they did. It\x92s a headache and now they are laying in the corner of their bedroom money wasted!!! <U+0001F615> "  "Great fun cameras. I bought two of these one for my 15 year old daughter & one for her bestie. They were early Christmas gifts for the girls while her friend was visiting us early. They love them. The picture quality is great and it\x92s fun to snap little photos with these. Highly recommend!! " 
 "The latch that secures the photo paper broke the first time it was opened. The photos were acceptable for what I was using them for.  The killer was the latch broke the first time it was opened.  I returned to Amazon for a refund. "  "Only works in ideal settings. Barely works unless your in bright light. Print quality is horrible. Overly simple interface give no feedback. How much would a simple led menu cost to add? I went with Kodak thinking they would have a better product than some China no name. My daughter has given up on it. " 
 "Won\x92t charge or work. Charged for four hours light is still flashing red and camera turns off after it turns on. Very disappointed child for Christmas "  "No charger in box. It\x92s not coming with charger. In this digital era I can\x92t even imagine a digital item is being sold without any charger. But in review Kodak is replying that it has charger. For additional accessories also charger is not coming as an option camera case memory cards are coming as option but not charger. "  "Question. I returned this item for one that charged and you promptly replaced it. However when I returned the initial camera I accidentally did not remove the 50 extra photo cards my daughter had placed in it that she had received for Christmas. Is there anyway I can get those back?!?! " 
 "Charging cord not included!. Haven\x92t even tried to take pictures with it yet it says that the camera and accessories are included in the box when you purchase it there is no charging cord!! "  "Great Gift For Teenage Daughter !. She loves it ! Great Birthday Gift for daughter. Takes it everywhere. It has the capability of a micro SD Card - so you can save photos and have them developed through Shutterfly etc. "  "Great for kids. My 5yo daughter loved this for Christmas. Would recommend. Picture quality isn\x92t great unless there is bright lighting. The picture prints out in its finished form it doesn\x92t develop after the camera spits it out like an old Polaroid camera. " 
 "Fun to use but picture quality is not great. I want to like this camera but the pictures do not look very good. The pictures look faded but not like a Polaroid retro kind of way. There are two settings one for color and the other for BW. BW picture is worse than colored ones. Overall I think Polaroid camera is better than this one. "  "Junk with Kodaks Name on it!. Picture quality is horribly low. Kodak should be embarrassed!! I bought 3 of these for my grand daughters every one of them is crap! Blurry pics red tint no matter what you do. Color calibration is a joke! Avoid this camera! " 
 "Purchased both black and pink models.  They were two different cameras. Pink Bad camera. Pink showed up with no charger...flash did not work under any light conditions....photos all very red and almost not able to recognize.  Pink recipient very disappointed on ChristmasBlack seemed to work a little better and came with charger and flash worked "  "Great gift. Received this for my birthday and so far I love it! Easy to use paper is inexpensive. Has color and black and white options. Rated down a star because it would be nice to have a zoom function and manual flash option. Picture quality is pretty good a bit grainy but I kind of expected that and I like the vintage feel it gives the photos. Photo processing time is about a minute sometimes it's hard to tell if it took the photo and is working but I'm still getting used to it. Overall I like it a lot! " 
 "Waste of money. The worst. Pictures came out red and blurry. I opted for this instead of fujifilm because it was cheaper but the quality was so horrible I ended up returning it and getting the fujifilm anyways. I got the 11 mini for $99 and it came with a carrying case 30 prints and the quality is excellent. "  "Stay at least 50 ft away. I mean if you like your pictures to look like you're looking through beer gogglesthis is your camera. "  "Don\x92t waste your time with this....horrible quality photos. I was extremely disappointed by the picture quality. I had low expectations but the quality was so blurry the photos were not usable. Very disappointed. Can\x92t believe a product with this low of quality is even available given how far we have come with photo quality in recent years. " 
 "Not worth the money. When I take pictures the film will sometimes get stuck and I have to open it and pull it out because when it prints the picture folds over causing it not to exit the camera and when it does successfully print the picture quality is god awful. It\x92s extremely blurry. I had high hopes but was left with a disappointment. Sorry for the awful review but I have to be honest. "  "You get what you pay for. Go to a camera shop. Paper would get stuck and finally melted a part of the camera. I threw the entire purchase into the trash. Extra film carrying case business cards to stick pictures on everything. Very disappointed " 
 "No USB cable. I ordered two of these cameras and both came without a USB cable.  Don\x92t know if product works as I am trying to charge with a cable I have. I am requesting a correct cable so there will not be future charging issues. "  "Cute and effective. It's a cute little camera and works great. I took one star off because there wasn't a charging cable luckily I had an old phone charger sitting around. "  "Low quality photos. The camera is easy to use but the photos are extremely low resolution. It's nearly impossible to get good lighting for these photos and the photos are grainy. The camera also takes a long time to print the picture so don't plan on taking back-to-back photos.Overall kind of fun for the novelty factor but there are other cameras out there with similar functions that are much better quality. " 
 "neat!. Near modern take on a Polaroid. Paper comes flipped so make sure you turn it around to get a picture. Hold it steady!!! But neat gift to create a memory board! "  "Happy and disappointed. The product and photos is what you expect from a instant camera. However we are disappointed on Christmas Day because this an era doesn\x92t come with a charger and my 11 year old can\x92t use it. We have to wait to get a charger when the stores are open. <U+0001F44E><U+2639><U+FE0F> "  "No charging cord. I purchased this for my granddaughter who loved it.  However it does not come with a charging cable with you have to purchase separately for $14+.  It does say that but not obviously.  I mistakenly assumed if it needed a cable it would have been included. How else can you use it? " 
 "Pictures are horrible. The pictures don't come out like advertised. Thank God it was only for my 10yr old so she thinks it's the coolest thing.. Truly piece of Garbage "  "Do. Not. Buy. This. Camera. We ordered and returned the first one received a second one and that too was defective.  A very sad granddaughter! "  "picture quality sucks. The picture quality is not good these pictures were taken in full sunlight outside amazing lighting but they still came out so blurry and with the weird filter. The camera is easy to use but I was really disappointed in the camera quality and I had even look through reviews I thought the pictures would be a little bit clearer but they\x92re not. " 
 "Easy to use.. My 10 year old Grand Daughter loves the camera takes good pictures. "  "No charger. Does not come with a charger but instructs you to use the provided charger to charge the camera upon opening. "  "Horrible picture quality!!!!. My daughter had the a Polaroid the one where the picture take a minute to appear!I got this one thinking it was an upgrade.This camera has very pore photo quality!So extremely disappointed as this was my kids main gift <U+0001F62D> prolly can\x92t return because open box and used the film that game with !!!Don\x92t buy this if your looking for a good pictures " 
 "Worst product I have EVER purchased EVER. If I hadn\x92t thrown the box away I would send it back.. Terrible quality in picsThe camera literally takes awful photos AND Looses it\x92s charge AFTER ONE PRINTING.Worst product EVER. "  "Pictures for shoes. For what I need it for it does it's job. I have about 120 pairs of shoes and I decided to post pictures outside the shoebox so I don't have to figure out which shoes are what. The picture quality is a bit blurry but because I don't really need the picture in HD. I didn't get a power cord and had a small dent. It does the job fine. " 
 "it\x92s Cute but... It\x92s cute but the picture and print quality is ok. I thought it would be a little bit clearer like a regular Polaroid. It\x92s a decent value for the money though. "  "Items missing. I just received my camera and upon opening I noticed that the packaging was already open. I take everything out and notice that there is no charger cord and the photo paper is missing. Also noticed a scratch on the bottom of the camera. This camera looks like it was previously used/returned. Will be getting my money back " 
 "Poor Quality and very blurry photos. I am very disappointed with the quality of the photos and how slow and un stable the camera actually is. I feel like for what I paid for this it is not worth the money! I was really looking forward to using this for my wedding and all the parties in between and I bought 1 first before buying more. I was very disappointed in all features of this camera. "  "Trash. This was a very disappointing purchase. After a month total of having it and using it three times the back stopped closing and the pictures kept jamming. This was a christmas gift and I can't even return it because this problem showed up right after the return window ended. Very disappointed. I would not recommend wasting your money on this garbage. " 
 "The best choice for instant cameras. What a fun little device! Doesn't do well in low lighting situations however it's a blast over the holidays! How does it print color or black and white? Voodoo magic. How does it print anything at all within 30 seconds?! Voodoo magic I suppose. However it does all of that I find this camera to be better than the equivalents from other brands. "  "Granddaughter's gift. My granddaughter is always going around taking photos on her smartphone so I thought she would enjoy trying an instant print camera. When I gave it to her she was confused she's never had a camera before and didn't know how to use it. Nice to know that us old folks can teach the youngsters a thing or two from time to time! She got the hang of it fast and was up and snapping photos before I knew it. Now she says she prefers this kind of camera to a smartphone looks like I did something right. " 
 "It really takes great pictures for kids. It really takes great pictures for kidsMy grandkids love the camera "  "Blurry useless photos. We tried different lighting inside and out. Always blurry. Faces washed out. We returned item. "  "A bit fuzzy. Photos come out a bit fuzzy and the pictures are very small. "  "Very poor picture and print quality.. Very poor picture and print quality. "  "Good. Got it for a friend amazing present! Looks good and it works good. Pictures are not perfect but it does the job. It doesn\x92t come with a charger but it needs one " 
 "Waste of money. This camera prints terrible pics. My daughter loves it so we\x92ll keep it but the pics stink. I would do better printing it on my home printer. "  "Amazing camera u should deff buy one. I bought this for myself and I am extremely happy with it add tanks great pictures and one of the best things as that back of the picture will peel off so it can be a sticker and the pictures print directly from the camera this is a gift I bought for myself for a Christmas present and I love everything about it " 
 "Crappy pictures awful button clicker. Save your money. Pictures are dark and have very poor quality. But the worst part is the Shutter button it is intentionally designed to be clicked by mistake making you waste photographic paper (THE WORST). Additionally the power button has the same issue thus the camera can self turn on and waste pictures even if it is in your backpack. I wish I given my gf a better gift. "  "Easy to use. My daughter loves this camera and it's so easy and fun for her to use " 
 "Can't use it without charger. Imagine the kid opened the present on Christmas morning at grandparents' house and found out that there is no charger coming with the camera and therefore couldn't use it.  The charging connectors that we have at home does not fit the camera.  If you want to know why Kodak can't compete with other brands don't need to do further investigation. "  "No charger included. This was a Christmas present for my niece and although she has enjoyed it so far it was surprising that a rechargeable camera did not come with a charging cable. Nowhere in the item description did it say that the changing cable is not included which was a bit of a let down when the camera died and we didn\x92t have a compatible cable on hand. " 
 "No charging cord in box.. Product came with no charging cord even though directions inside box said plug in using enclosed cord. Luckily had cord from other product that could use. "  "Overall Experiance. We bought this for our 7 year old son for Christmas.  The reason we chose this over the other Instamax camera was this had the feature of also allowing for digital pictures.  The features are just not there it needs some improvement before I would recommend this.  If looking for an instant picture camera go with the Instamax. " 
 "Don't waste the time or money.. No charger cord very poor quality pictures.  Terrible waste of money. "  "The pictures come out dark. I was so excited about this camera because I wanted to get it for my grandfather since he doesn\x92t understand digital cameras and he misses taking pictures and the directions were very straight forward but every picture we take either comes out dark or completely black and I\x92m really upset I want him to be able to use it. "  "Absolutely horrible!. Horrible print quality! Comes out red blurry and no colors. AVOID at all costs!Wasted money!!! Any review that is good has got to be fake. " 
 "Camera. Great camera and of course with printing capability "  "Really Santa!?!?!?!. Got this for our daughter for xmas.  The prints come out terrible.  Not sure if we got a bad one but HIGHLY unsatisfied for the price.  Terrible camera.  The sad part is I cannot return this since it was her Santa gift. She is 8 and still believes in Santa.  If she wouldn't be devastated I would be sending this back. "  "Bad image and printing quality. I was waiting for a better product with more features as described a better image quality and also a better printing quality. My roomate has the Instax mini 11 that is $10 more expensive but 10x times better than the Kodak I got.So disappointed.Also in the picture there many things shown with the camera but in the package there\x92s only the camera without even a cable to charge it. " 
 "Extremely Poor Quality Photos. The idea is great but the product isn't.  I purchased one and returned it because all photos looked orange/over exposed.  The viewfinder outline and center are not accurate so the object in the photos are cut off.  I exchanged the camera and had the same issues with the replacement.  I returned the camera and will not purchase it again. "  "Cheaply Made. This camera looks really cool. But it is cheaply made. I have already ordered 2. Both of them are defective. The back case does not seal properly. That in turn affects the quality of your photos because it lets in a bit of light. Kodak needs to reevaluate their model and improve it. Definitely not worth the money<U+0001F615> " 
 "Good quality but paper stuck. HelloHaving issues after 2 shots and print the paper is now stuck. Tried the troubleshooting but nothing. What must I do? "  "Camera stopped printing after first picture printed. I bought this for my daughter for Easter(today). She took one picture and the quality was horrible. I am not worried about the quality as much as I am worried about the product working. Well it stopped working after that first picture. Sending it back. Did the option for the replacement but I canceled that also and will buy a different one to try. " 
 "Takes great pictures. This is very easy to use and takes great pictures.  Just be careful putting you finger near the flash at the top or you make waste a picture by mistake. Once you take the pictures others want them so make sure you have plenty of film. Great purchase and good gift. "  "Not pleased. I ordered this for my daughter for Christmas looked like a great product but was super disapointed pictures are not clear at all. Takes long to charge print of photos is horrible .. I would send the extra $ an buy another camera with I had to. " 
 "Good little camera. Bought the camera for my 3 (almost 4)  year old daughter. She LOVES it! She was so happy to get a camera and after the first shutter click when she saw it printing a pic she absolutely lost her mind! Great for kids. "  "Broken product not worth the hassle. I bought this to take some fun Polaroids with my girlfriend on adventures but after only the first try the printer jammed and wouldn\x92t print the photo. Looks like a cheap loading system and the paper won\x92t even move. Definitely not worth the money and very disappointing that we couldn\x92t capture some really fun moments together on our anniversary on Polaroid. " 
 "Camera is fun and works great!. My 9 year old loves to take instant print pictures of things and hang them around her mirror. The quality of pictures is great. It is easy to use and refill. Great camera and fun to actually have the pictures printed since I never take the time to actual print them. "  "Terrible camera not worth the price. Terrible camera did not come with charger and picture quality is terrible for price would never buy again!!Do not purchase! "  "Fun inexpensive but not high image quality. It is what it is. Picture quality is not terrific but it is quick and easy to use. Even a toddler can use it. I installed a microSD card in it so it also captures digital images which is a nice feature. It will be fun to see what it captures at our kid\x92s birthday party. " 
 "Practical and easy to use. We got this for our baby shower and it was a hit. The quality of the pictures are not the best but it's very easy to use and comes in handy. Everybody loved when we took a picture with our guests and gave them as a gift. "  "The back notches on the back of the camera were broken off. And it looks refurbished. And the camera was so broken on the back the film is good the ink is fine but it looks refurbished it looks like someone sent it in and they shipped it off as a brand new item. It looks like the person who owned it originally had ripped a box and it appears Amazon did not try to replace the box. Are used to work for Amazon I get it " 
 "Kodak is Good. It prints out pictures right on site. I get the picture in 30sec "  "Christmas gift for my Son\x92s Girlfriend. She loves it just what she wanted kinda surprised her as well! "  "Bad. This camera is terrible. You barely touch it and it takes pics. Wasting a lot of paper. Paper compartment very small and easily breakable. A waste of money. "  "Quality. This was exactly what I ordered for my grand-daughter and she loved it! "  "Printing dosent work neither does memory card. My memory card dosent work and my photos won\x92t print right I\x92m really upset because I saved up for it for it and it doesn\x92t work correctly " 
 "Good purchase for a child but not a high quality product by any means. Cute little camera for my 9 year old. Love that it prints and uses sticker paper but it does not hold a charge very long and sometimes simply doesn\x92t work for no reason. "  "Wouldn\x92t buy again. Picture quality isn\x92t that great pictures come out looking weird and it dies really fast "  "The pictures do not turn out very clear. We were so excited to get this but the picture quality is really not very good. It's better when the flash is used but the flash only comes on in the dark. " 
 "Makes a great gift!. I bought as a gift for my niece for her summer camp trips she loves it. She doesn\x92t have to shoot and print all in one go she can print what she wants when she wants. "  "Had potential but major flop. This camera had so much potential. The photo quality severely downgraded when the battery was low. The back of the photo was difficult to peel (sticky back). The photo took a while to print. You never really know if you successfully took a photo.The one thing I really like about this camera is that it has an SD card slot so you can save the pics you take from the camera. " 
 "No color photos. Handful of photos and the color ones wouldn\x92t work. Will order some new photo paper and see if it works better this time around. "  "Make sure the camera is held still. It is a nice camera and fun to have with you if you want to take pictures and give them to your friends "  "Don't Buy Broke the first week.. Don't bother it broke the first week I bought it. Took it to our vacation and door that opens up to insert the photo paper broke. We only used it 4 days and the springs which hold the door popped out. Couldn't find them on the ground so basically just money down the drain... Printed Pictures are ok. " 
 "Low quality pics. I bought these for my 7 and 5 year old girls for Christmas. While they are easy to use the picture quality really isnt there. Id say its good for that age group and not much older. "  "Would never buy one again!. Bought this for our 9 year old granddaughter and we are VERY DISSATISFIED with the product. Difficult for a young person to use. "  "I\x92m giving it one star just to get this posted.. Ordered this camera a month early as a birthday present for my daughter. When we opened the package we found that the back panel where film is loaded did not close. Because of Kodak\x92s one month return policy I am stuck with a camera no one can use. I would think the company could afford to do a little bit better for its customers. " 
 "Poor quality pictures. I returned it "  "Great gift for young children. Great gift for young children but it\x92s really difficult to fine film "  "Have yet to get a good picture.. Pictures are poor quality. May workBetter in bright light but does NOT work good inside. "  "Worked for less than 24 hours. We gave this to my son for Christmas and it malfunctioned in less than 24 hours. Did the reset per Kodak customer service and the issue didn\x92t resolve. They informed me to return it. We did not repurchase. "

Now that I've got this printer I'm afraid I can't stop taking photos. I don't know what it is about it exactly but whenever I place it in my hands I begin to have an uncontrollable urge to photograph everything and everyone I see. As it prints instantly I have to hand the photos over to those I took a picture of. People aren't always greatful why should they be but I get a kick out of it anyway. It's nice to have another addiction in my life I was getting bored with the others. " 
 "Decent camera. Camera quality is what you expect on a camera like this.. This camera is good if you want printed photos right away. The camera quality is what you would expect on a camera like this.On YouTube if you search this camera is shows features like a switch to print colored or B&W photos but this version DOES NOT have that switch. "  "bad product.  Stay away!. very bad!!!  A product that does not match anything listed above.  Does not take pictures.  Once in a while .. takes out a completely white page.  It has basic issues and does not come with a charger.  Just do not buy.  A real product that is being worked on " 
 "Perfect gift for EVERYONE!!. My mother had a camera of a similar brand hers is awesome! I decided this would be the perfect gift for my teen daughter lo and behold it was. She loves it these little cameras are really neat for anyone wanting pictures then and there at the moment. "  "Was this suppose that come with a charging cable. I did not get a charging cable which you have to have to use I did not see where it needs to be purchased separate? "  "Poor picture. I liked the concept very much. But the picture quality is very poor.the size of picture is to small.  The cameradirections are very simple for a camera that still has some quirks. " 
 "BURNS HANDS !!!!! TAKE CAUTION !!!!. PURCHASED FOR MY13 YR OLD HAVE HAD GREAT EXPERIENCE WITH PRIOR KODAK INSTA CAMERAS HOWEVER THIS 1 IS A CAMERA FROM HELL..... !!!! LIGHT IS ALWAYS BILINKIN MAKES WEIRD CHIRPING NOISE LIKE ITS NEVER CHARGED .... ONLY WILL PRINT HALF OF PICTURES TAKEN HAVE TRIED MANY MICRO SD CARDS ??? AND STILL SAME PROB WONT PRINT PROPERLY & IS SKULLDING HOT TO HOLD !!! "  "Don\x92t waste your money. Never worked. Came in pieces and completely fell apart. Big disappointment. Bought it as a present. " 
 "Useless.. I bought this camera as a Christmas gift for  my niece. At first it worked perfectly fine. Then when we put in the new photo paper the pictures wouldn't print and the corners of the paper kept getting snagged somehow while it was printing. I felt so bad because she was so excited when she opened her gift to just have it stop working the same day. "  "Good for a child camera. Good camera for price but the quality of the images you get aren't great to say the least. "  "Ehh. The backing doesn\x92t stay on this camera I really would be returning it if I didn\x92t already throw the box away. It was a Christmas present for my 4 year old. And she can hardly use it because the back doesn\x92t stay on. <U+0001F62D> " 
 "Cute polariod. Great camera! So far so good. I love that it prints the mini poloroids. My daughter was very pleased with it. "  "Good price for quality pictures. No dislikes. My granddaughter loved it. "  "Instant camera. This was great for our open house. "  "Stopped working after 3 months. We got this camera for my daughter's birthday and after going through about 2 packs of film the picture quality deteriorated.  All the pictures have a white cloud through the top 1/3 of the picture.  We've changed the film and tried resetting the camera and nothing has helped.  We are past our return window and now have a camera that doesn't work. " 
 "Not worth it. Dont waste your money the pictures come out blurry it takes forever to take a picture and expensive to refill "  "It is a gift. It arrived in a timely manner a little disappointed that the \ "Gift Bundle\ " did not included cable charger or memory chip. "  "TERRIBLE quality. The photos from this camera are streaked and the colors are very dull and not sharp either.  For $70 this is a POS.  I honestly wouldn't bother if it cost $10.  This is a terrible product.  avoid at any cost.  Kodak should be ashamed. " 
 "Reasonable camera for the price. My package did not come with camera strap.Good camera for the price . Need good lighting and pictures are certainly reasonable.  Fun print outs.  There is some lag in the time from pushing the button and capturing the shot so ideally people must stand still. "  "Got a defective unit.. I bought this for my wifes birthday and it has never worked right.  It needs to be reset after each picture which is very inconvenient for my 73 year old wife. I will need to send it back. " 
 "Photos are poor quality camera is decent. Birthday gift pretty decent quality photos don't really come out great though. "  "DON\x92T WASTE YOUR MONEY  JUNK.. I ordered this product for my daughter for Christmas.  ALL THE PICTURES ARE ORANGE.  We spent time following the directions and calibration of the camera.  ALL THE PICTURES ARE ORANGE!  Indoor and outdoor photos low light sun light extra paper pack .  REQUESTED A REFUND AND HAVEN\x92T RECEIVED ANYTHING.  CURRENTLY OUT $50.  DON\x92T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS.  Would have expected a better Kodak product. " 
 "Stopped Printing after about 10 photos. Awful device. Picture quality is poor. And it just stopped printing after the 1st 10 photos. "  "Flash doesn\x92t work when it should. It\x92s about impossible to get the flash to work when you want it to. It automatically senses the dark supposedly but one picture to the next in the same room won\x92t produce flash. I wasted about 6 films before I decided I just can\x92t use the camera inside or at night. Disappointed "  "Not pleased. The picture quality is horrible. The instructions on how to install the blue sheet could have been clearer. " 
 "Meh. Picture quality is pretty terrible. No charger. And no real instructions. Spend a little more and go with a different brand. "  "Total waste of money. Photo quality is garbage and I had to order a separate USB cable just to charge the camera. Please read the reviews before buying. "  "Paper jams and picture quality is poor. Purchased this for Christmas for 11 yr old.  Out of 8 pictures taken 5 prints jammed.  I checked how the print paper was loaded several times and everything was fine.  Also the print quality isn't very good at all colors are not bright and they are off-color not what we should expect from an instant camera in 2018.  Returned the item for a refund. " 
 "Cheap. This product is not worth the money. The quality of the prints are terrible. The camera is CHEAP "  "Love printable camera. I loved the camera... No USB charger came with it so I couldn't charge it and they tried to make me buy the charger <U+0001F621><U+0001F621><U+0001F621> "  "Low quality of picture. My review with 1 star is more about the low quality of picture that always shows somewhat blurry image no matter how we took the picture. So I concluded it is intrinsic problem of camera. So my kid does not play with it after 1st day. If someone believes 1day play is good for ~$50 sure please go ahead enjoy the moment. " 
 "Nice camera if treated well. I would not recommend gifting this as you may not know the condition of the item when whoever you gift I to opens the box. I like the product but this  camera arrived scuffed and scratched like it was not new. Seller says this is normal due to wharehouse treatment so no telling what the camera will look like when it arrives. "  "Cheap. The camera is made out of plastic and the picture quality is okay. Could be better. "  "Cute camera. Cute little Polaroid camera. I like how you can use a micro sd card. Not wo sure about how you have to load the camera because the film isn't protected like in other polaroid film cases. " 
 "A Fun & Easy away To Share Memories. This is a fun creative way of saving and showing off memories. It will never meet a smart phone or digital camera\x92s image quality but it\x92s convenient and easy to use and store both using it and getting images printed. "  "The description says there is a black white mode and a switch for it on the camera but there is not.. Haven't used it yet but just want other buyers to know IT DOES NOT HAVE THE BLACK WHITE SWITCH referred to in the documentation and the product description on Amazon.  Giving it 4 stars because I'm hoping for the best with other features. " 
 "Fun party item!. The camera is so fun to use. Picture quality not great but the stickers are fun. Wish it came with the SIMS card included. Have to remember to keep it charged. Takes a while to know that your picture took and easy to hit the button several times checking causing several pictures to print of the same thing. "  "Junk - don\x92t buy - waste of money. Camera didn\x92t come with a charger even though the box says it does.The picture quality is exceptionally poor literally the worst I\x92ve ever seen from any kind of camera " 
 "Waste of money!. No matter how many times you try you will never take a decent photo with this piece of trash camera thus leaving you stuck with it. It's cute....but don't be fooled! "  "Picture quality not so great!. The camera seems strong and looks great however I expected better picture quality. When reviewing videos on different instant cameras in order to decide which one to buy I thought this one was the best but the picture quality in person is nothing like they show on the videos. The package was quite banged up when I received it so I\x92m not sure if it may have gotten a bit damaged but I was a quite disappointed " 
 "A night to remember. I bought this instant print camera as a gift for my best friend. She's going away to university this year and I'm going to miss her. I gave her a going away party and presented the gift to her. She loved it and we spent all night taking photos with our friends. It was a night to remember. "  "Breaks easily. Not recommended. Worked well for 2 days. I followed all the instructions. Then the paper got stuck. I searched online to troubleshoot but couldn\x92t fix it. Returned to Amazon and asked for a replacement. Replacement came quick but it was also a dud. It would turn on but won\x92t take a picture. Returned again and got someMoney back " 
 "Very disappointing. I bought this for my son\x92s graduation party and was very disappointed we couldn\x92t get it to work so missed the opportunity for guests to take a photo with him to put in his guest signature book and write a message to him ruined my excitement to do this for my son to capture this important event in his life "  "Awesome. My niece loved it. "  "Flash washes me out :(. The camera is pretty good for the most part! However I have yet to figure out if you can turn the flash off but it\x92s pretty brutal. I\x92m a bit pale so it washes me out in most pictures. Obviously the print/picture quality isn't great but that wasn\x92t really the purpose of buying the camera " 
 "Good. Really good material but the quality of the photos is medium but im happy with the purchase. "  "This product was not the best at all. Wasn\x92t really pleased at all with this the camera took forever to snap then just started printing its own thing would not recommend "  "Buyer beware. This is the camera only apparently when you pay more for a gift set your just giving them more money "  "This is the worst camera I have ever used. This is the worst camera I have ever used.  The photos are blue toned and what you see in the eye hole is not what will print. The shoot button is so sensitive that it is easy to take photo by accident. It seemed like a cool idea but it is a big disappointment. " 
 "Worst buy of my life. Wish I never bought it. Everything that could go wrong goes wrong. It gets jammed while printing. It\x92s picture quality is horrible. Imagine opening your eyes under water in a pool. That\x92s the quality of these pictures :) "  "Did not hold a charge and didn't work. I am very disappointed as this camera never worked for me. I charged it and it came on but wouldn't print as the red light was flashing. So I tried charging it again. It never worked. "  "I love the idea. I love the idea and I love the camera BUT the picture quality is not to my liking. It works but I wish it was a lot more clear. " 
 "Okay quality. It\x92s a good camera but the quality isn\x92t the best. "  "Just okay. The pictures come out super blurry. It's just okay. "  "Received this used.. This came used. With film in the camera and a couple pictures that had been taken. No charging cord. "  "Christmas present. Awesome camera "  "Not worth the money. I wish I could review pics before printing. Easy to use otherwise. "  "I\x92m Ready For My Close Up. I purchased this for my son and gave him my camera from the 70\x92s when I was in Jr. HS. He loves it. " 
 "Photo opportunity. A printer for all situations literally. I was hanging out behind the bus station when I noticed this beautiful woman. She was standing there alone all by herself. I didn't see anyone else around. I decided to take an instant photo. My hands were sweaty as I fumbled with the camera nearly dropping it in my frustrated state but I got the shot in the end. It turned out great. I think I'll keep using this camera for all my photo opportunities. "  "Do Not Waste Your Money!!!. Terrible quality. Do not waste your money! I bought my kids a $20 digital camera a few years ago that took way better pictures than this. Most of the pictures don\x92t turn out and those that actually come out are certainly not anywhere near the vibrant photos advertised. I want my money back! " 
 "Very good quality. Thank you for item! Fast delivery and good quality! Amazing packing! "  "pleased.. It works well.  The problem is you have to be very careful in how you position the person you are taking the pic of.  I used it to take pics of the kids in first grade and it worked very well once I figured out how to line up the kids took a few pics but after that it was fine. "  "Loving this so far!. We've only had this about 24 hours but my daughter LOVES THIS CAMERA. It's easy to use and prints out quickly and with good quality. We haven't yet put a mini SD card in it but we do have one we are going to use. Will update about how that goes! " 
 "Cheap get by insta print camera. Great camera however print quality is quite poor. Works for our purpose. "  "This was a joke. All the pictures are blurry and it\x92s just poor quality "  "NO CHARGER CORD SUPPLIED!!!. Not everyone has a micro cord. Very dissapointed granddaughters when they couldn't use cameras till charged!!! Poor selection by Grampa! I thought buying Kodak was a quality brand. WRONG!! "  "You will waste your $ & time!. Do NOT buy this camera - No charging cord!!! This wasted my daughters hard earned money. This camera was her dream.Unfortunately I did not look under the questions \x93How do I charge it??because I assumed it would come with a charging cable. Pages & pages of people\x92s writing No charging cord <U+0001F629><U+0001F62B> " 
 "Its not gonna be the greatest but decent. It isn't the worse camera around. Definitely something for kids or someone just wanting a instant print. The quality of pictures is low but its to be expected for what the price was and the cost of photos. My kid is happy learning to hold it still as possible. "  "Great concept. The picture quality is not as good as I expected.The pictures are definitely better quality outside but it\x92s winter for us so maybe not a great Christmas gift. "  "I take it to the park. I don't know about other users but I always take my printomatic with me wherever I go. I find that this way I don't miss out on life's little surprises I can catch them all on my own individual camera. Now that I've gotten this thing I can finally do what I've always dreamed of take pictures of people in the park with their dogs. I'm a bit of a dog fanatic so you'll understand why this is so important to me. " 
 "Pretty disappointed!. Was sad that I had to return this item. Had high hopes in the quality of the pictures since it was a Kodak. The quality was blurry and no matter what angle we used to align the guide up in the view finder the picture always came out crooked :( sad day when I had to return it. "  "Great. Great camera "  "Great. Good quality "  "Do not buy. Every pic blurry it really sucks "  "Just ok. Picture quality isn't great. Have to hold very still or it's a blur. It's a cute fun camera though. " 
 "Poor Quality or Dud?. I don\x92t think ours works properly. Bought for my daughter as a gift. Camera photos were blurry and then it stopped taking photos after a couple weeks. Truly disappointed. "  "Very Poor Product. Looks really cute and my daughter was really excited for it. We've done the full calibration read all instructions and EVERY picture comes out blurry and hardly recognizable. The paper is also very expensive which you thought maybe was worth it if the pictures looked good. They don't. I waited too long to return it and now were stuck with a paperweight :( " 
 "Print quality needs work. Cool camera but the print quality is definitely lacking. "  "Picture. Every picture I have taken comes out blurry or discolored "  "Not all that impressive. Has no flash pictures come out a bit blurry only for outside or lots of light must be super delicate with it or the pictures won't come out any good. Not all that for me. Kinda weak. "  "Half decent photo quality. Off angles though. The photo quality isn't amazing obviously but the main downside is that the picture doesn't isn't aligned right with the photo focus on the camera. The photos come off slightly off angle from what you took a photo of unless you hold still for a few moments after snapping the picture. The film also loses its color a little faster than I'd like for a photo that's meant to be stuck to things " 
 "broken. This camera takes damaged photos a total waste of money. I did all the trouble shooting it still doesnt work "  "It's a good one. I took my new printomatic to a party this weekend. I was the lady of the hour but only for the hour. I took pictures of all my friends and their dates I wish I had a date to bring but I guess I'm not cool enough to have one. Oh well I had a fun time with my camera at least. It's a great one really brings out the color in the room "  "Chinese trash. Do not do no do not buy this product. This is total trash. I took one pic with it and now it doesn\x92t work. To be honest I knew it was going to be trash once we opened it to find there was zero cords in it. No power cord. No kind of transferring cord like you normally get when buying something new. It\x92s about the same quality as late night 1800 numbers selling trash! Don\x92t buy this! " 
 "Very disappointed. So disappointed with this camera. I got it for my trip to Costa Rica and the pictures are very out of frame they print awfully and many times they don\x92t print at all. It keeps making the printing noise but nothing comes out. Very sad I was very excited to use it since it had good reviews but it did not work for me. "  "<U+0001F495>. <U+0001F495> "  "<U+0001F495>. <U+0001F495> "  "Have to be very steady to have a clear shot. Not easy for a 6 yr old. Have to be very stable to keep from blurring and no check before printing. Prints no matter what. Cost of the paper makes it not worth the purchase knowing what i know now. " 
 "Disappointed. Arrived today am very disappointed it feels very cheap like a toy and is small.Didn\x92t work at all and have started a return.Did arrive fast tho but don\x92t recommend "  "Perfect for teens!!. This camera is easy to use set upetc. You just charge it turn it on and do your thing. You load up your printer paper sheets and go to town. Perfect gift for a teenager "  "Cute but not the best. I purchase 2 camera as a gift cute but not the best! "  "No quality. Quality of photos aren\x92t there. Don\x92t even think about this one. Not worth the try " 
 "Blurry pictures. I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my 13 yr old granddaughter and she has yet to get a clear picture. I even went out and purchased an sd card. "  "It's was ok. Not he best but it was for my kid she enjoyed.so I do to not the best quility but also not a waist of money  didn't spend a lot so don't expect a lot u get what I pay for "  "Low quality. It's really easy to accidentally take a picture. Then the picture automatically prints. Very wasteful and not cost effective. Stopped printing after the third picture. Returned mine. " 
 "Keep refills on hand. Love the camera wish the pictures came out a little clearer but other an that its great "  "Don\x92t buy blurry pictures half white. Pictures are blurry when they are printing half is white. Kid disappointed family disappointed I\x92m angry. Instead of me paying money for this product the company should pay me for wasting my time and nerves. "  "Nope!. I do not like the quality of the photos. Every picture is blurry and colorless. The product used false advertising to trick people to purchase. " 
 "Poor Design Features. Power button protrudes from back of unit so the camera very frequently turns on resulting in very short battery life.Even a full charge battery does not last. Also very easy to accidentally take a picture.I do not recommend this camera. "  "Post it note photos. Most people wouldn't think to use their photos are post it notes but I would. These sticky backed photographs are perfect for using as post it notes. I can stick them on the fridge table or wherever and write myself little reminders on the front. I guess it ruins the photo but what do I care it makes me feel good! " 
 "Satisfied.. Bought it for my 11 yr old nephew. He loves it .I gave 3 stars for picture quality though. "  "No charger/no wrist strap. Did not come with a wrist strap or charger! Had to take my little boy out to buy those item that should have been included per standard camera packaging. Photo color quality is also not the best. Everything comes out pink! "  "Performed great for my wedding!. Very happy I went with this camera for my guest book at our ceremony-guests loved it! Easy to use surprisingly good quality pictures and the charge life is decently long. Would recommend to a friend " 
 "As expected  low to medium quality. It takes pictures and prints it out in color. Picture quality is not the greatest but due to the small size of prints deficiencies get masked. This is in no way a replacement of a regular camera but a fun little thing at parties "  "Pictures come out blurry. Bought this camera for my daughter for Christmas. All the pictures come out blurry. Not worth it considering the photo paper is very expensive "  "Not all it\x92s cracked up to be. No cord included to charge.. the film included must have been old or something.. pictures came out with the color all messed up.. and streaked " 
 "get lost with this camera. With this instant printer in my hands it's always photo time. I feel like I can catch every moment moments in life that I've missed or been neglecting like a paper bag blowing in the wind. I just go out wandering in the city and get lost for hours. "  "Ok for kids but don't expect much. Picture quality not great especially indoors it'll have a pink tint. Not too bad in sunlight though. And the battery dies very quickly. "  "Not user friendly poor quality photos. Picture quality is pretty poor for today\x92s standards and it is fairly slow as well if you are wanting to take multiple shots. Loading the paper and overall use is not very user friendly. Prone to glitches and it\x92s easy to take accidental shots. Nice for a novelty but you won\x92t want to use it for much. " 
 "trash. very poor quality picture you have to be perfectly still to obtain a decent picture "  "Broke immediately. We didn\x92t even get through the 10 trial prints before it broke. The camera won\x92t print and makes a weird noise. I can\x92t even message the seller to communicate this. "  "did not come with chord.. Did not come with chord! bought for my daughter for Christmas. Called Amazon told them I did not want to return camera I just wanted charger chord. told me I would have to order chord they would take $3.00 off. bought chord for $10.00 on Amazon does not fit! Thanks for the help Amazon (sarcastic). " 
 "Nice camera  but ni. Pictures come out distorted "  "Never worked.  Complete waste of money. Never able to get the camera to work. I've rebuilt car transmissions and computers this camera is junk.  Doesn't work properly. Never has even after fiddling with it for hours. "  "Not worth it. Don\x92t waste your money on this camera. The pictures come out blurry and no matter how you look through the lens the pictures come out with half of it cut off or not centered. "  "great but a few flaws. The picture button has a hair trigger and you can't even tell you've clicked it. It also powers on and off quite easily it's a pain in the ass. But who cares- THIS THING IS SO FUN " 
 "Look no further. Compared to other instant print cameras this one is top of the line in its class. The simple design lends for easier use but also high quality photos that you wouldn't expect from such a small printer. I just took it out to the park to try some shots and was surprised by how great they look. If you want and instant print camera with high quality photos look no further. "  "Great camera perfect gift but difficult to find film. Like the camera but difficult to find film for it " 
 "Not worth $50. The design is not kids proof.  A 7yr old cannot use it without accidentally pushing the button that cause it to take pictures.  As an adult I accidentally push the button when I go set the camera down.  The placement of your hands is also not comfortable.  The quality of the pic is $20(at best) camera. Not a $50 camera. "  "piece of junk. printed the first picture and then all pictures afterwards are  printed washed out with just light blue/gray color. "  "Perfect throwback.. A fun gift and a throwback to the good old days.  Not a camera you use for scenery but as a household fun camera you couldn't ask for more. " 
 "the best camera of its type for the price.. both a digital and zink instant camera in one. others that do the same thing cost $99 plus...same sd card zink film same resulting picture. real happy with mine. "  "NOT for quality photos just quality time taking them.. Camera wasn't as described:NO charging cable.NO black and white option button.Photos look NOTHING like the quality of the photos in the product pics.Worth $50? Eh Probably not. I read Fujifilm is much better. "  "One for the road. So glad I finally got the chance to try out kodak's new instant print camera. I've always been a big supporter of their brand and products to to get my hands on this was a real treat. Now that I've been playing with it for a while I understand what a fun yet practical camera is can be. Useful in just about any conditions it's really something you can take with you everywhere. " 
 "it's their sponteneity. What I like most about instant printers like this one is how quickly they work. There's really something special about them that makes them better than even the most advanced cameras. It's their sponteneity. You can pull them out at any moment and capture great shots in ways you just can't with fancier cameras. "  "Awful picture quality. Beautiful camera but picture quality is just awful..i would not recommend this "  "Missing charger.. No charger included. The box only came with the camera. The charger was missing " 
 "CRAP!. CRAP! The images are yellow and not centered! I will be returning. "  "Awesome!. Was a gift!  She loves it!  Great customer service!  Your the best! "  "Great Little Camera. I bought this camera for my 7 year old grandchild. He loves it. Easy to use. He loves the instant gratification of being able to see the pictures within a matter of minutes. "  "Doesnt match the description. Ive ordered this camera twice now and both times it hasnt worked right it doesnt switch between black and white and color photoes and the buttons dont match the owners manual which i had to download they are either in wrong places or non existent im not verry satisfied with the color or picture of the prints at all " 
 "Fun camera for my son!. My son loved it! It was missing the charging cable though so that was disappointing. However we had something else with the same charger that worked. Fun camera! "  "green is my favorite color. Cute little instant print camera. Comes in so many beautiful colors I chose green because I love bananas and jake the dog from adventure time. Too bad that show ended it had such a good run over the years. Oh well at least I've got my camera to remind me of all the fun moments we had watching the show. I think I'll dress up like jake and take some pics around town. Peace. " 
 "Buen producto. Fotos de buena calidad c\xe1mara de buena calidad. El bot\xf3n de disparo de foto muy sensible puedes tomar fotos sin querer "  ". Fotos de buena calidad c\xe1mara de buena calidad. El bot\xf3n de disparo de foto muy sensible puedes tomar fotos sin querer "  "Simple enough for me. Finally a camera even I can use. My friends say I'm a bit technologically challenged I can't even operate a smartphone. Okay it's not that bad but seriously me and technology just don't get along. Thankfully I found this instant print camera and fell in love with it. Simple and intuitive I use it whenever I need to take great pictures. " 
 "Bad. Nothing to like and everything to dislike! Had to send back very poor product. "  "Won't print. It doesn't work it won't print even if I change the paper and calibration paper. Battery doesn't last long. Prints come blank or with a white strip. Already spent 2 paper bundles for trial and non will come out right. "  "Terrible pictures. This camera is terrible!!! The pictures are all EXTREMELY blurry. I bought it for my 9 year old and so far we have taken one somewhat decent picture but it still is very poor quality. Don't waste your money. " 
 "Meh.... The picture turned out ok if it's bright or if there's sufficient lightning. The square inside the viewfinder is hard to see for certain people. I do like that the film is a sticker. I probably would spend a bit more for a better instant camera. "  "Horrible picture quality. Bought it for my niece and quality of pictures very poor  for as much at it cost I would not recommend to anyone "  "One of the best. I'm sure others have mentioned this already but I'll say it again this is one of the best instant cameras on the market. It's simplicity yet excellence is unparelleled. Takes great looking analog photos and saves them all to digital format as well. The perfect kind of instant printer in a modern world. " 
 "The camera does not come with a charger!. There is not a charger included in the box for the camera and it does not tell you that anywhere on the packaging! Very disappointing  especially when you buy it for your grandson's birthday and he opens it and is unable to use it. <U+0001F620> "  "Camera. I got this for Christmas for my daughter and she loved it of course she ran through her films in a day lol but she loves it diff worth it "  "helped me get over the slumps. Wow you guys this Kodak printomatic is just what I needed to spice up my life during quarantine. I'm sure like most of us you're feeling cooped up but I can say that this little camera has made me feel better about life. Anywere I go now on the bus to the store for a walk in the park I make sure to have my instant print camera with me. It's taught me to find beauty in life's dull moments. " 
 "Cheap. Cheap product "  "Get a lot of use. Got this cute yellow printomatic for my little girl's tenth birthday and she was so excited you should have seen her little face I could tell from how excited she was that this was the one she really wanted. She thanked me and gave me a big hug then ran off to take photos with her sister. I think they're really going to get a lot of use out of it. "  "Tired of my phone. Got tired to taking digital photos with my phone so I decided to get a little camera and thought this would be a nice first camera. I'm so glad I bought it because I'm finding out it's a lot more enjoyable to take photos with a real camera then a phone and you get an instant print right there in your hands. " 
 "Simply ideal. Thought this would make a good beginner's camera for me. I've always been interested in photography but never found the time to do it until now. I'm glad I went with the printomatic. Simple to use which is great for me and the pics look amazing. The lens and auto focus do most of the work. Simply ideal. "  "Low res pictures.. Easy to use but no focus leads to blurry pictures and fuzzy low resolution. "  "very nice lil guy. cute! so fun ! girlfriend loves it "  "This camera is awesome!. This camera is perfect!! I love taking silly pictures with my kids and getting them instantly! The quality of the pictures are great! It has a flash which helps with the picture quality! Definitely a must buy!!! " 
 "She loves it but no charger. Works great but didn\x92t come with charger. I had to use a Samsung charger to charge it. "  "No charger. The manual said that a charger was included.  We did not get one!!!! "  "Love it!!!. I love this Product and the quality of pictures that it takes! The film is a little pricey but it is worth the convenience. "  "Don't buy. Camera came with no charging cord! I gbought it as a Christmas gift for my child and she couldn't even use it because we couldn't charge it! I should have read the reviews because this happened to alot of customers. " 
 "The pictures are not clear. I thought this product would be fun for my granddaughter but for the price the pictures are small and blurry!! "  "Not what I paid for. Like the other reviews have said this is not what I paid for. The camera I got seems like an older version as it can only go 5MP not the 10 advertised and can only hold up to 32gb of memory on an SD card not the 256gb advertised.It did not even come with a charger and came dead. "  "I wanted to like this so much oh wellllll. This is the worst printing camera on the market. The pictures come out with a pink hue every time no matter how many times I run the blue paper color corrector through it. The pictures come out zoomed in even when the subject that I photograph is well within the centered square while taking the photo. " 
 "A really revealing camera. What I like about this camera is that it prints instantly. What you shoot is what you get there's no need to edit or choose the perfect photo. It's almost like communicating in another language or something. I feel like when I hand someone a picture I just took of them a moment ago they're receiving a karmic still life relieving their hang ups and aspirations. A truly revealing camera. "  "this camera sucks.. the photos are small and low quality. "  "No charging cord?!. Bought this as a gift and had it sent directly to the recipient - but it didn't come with a charging cord (despite saying that it does)?!?  how the heck are you supposed to use it without a charging cord?!  Apparently this has happened to a lot of people. " 
 "This camera is perfect for children and adults. I love my instant camera...I like that the pictures are stickers that's y I picked this one and I'm glad I did. "  "Camera is not working correctly. Film will not come out on its own I bought in Oct. I need to return this item. I ordered it in Oct for a Christmas gift and the time to return ran out before the gift was given. Pic quality is poor and the film gets stuck and will not come out unless you pull it. "  "Cool little camera. If you want an intant print camera that prints fast and is easy to use then look no further the printomatic is the one for you. Reasonably priced it's one of the best instant printers I've come across. I just tried mine out the other day and I spent the whole afternoon in the city with my dog snapping quick shots. What a cool little invention. " 
 "Buy a Better Camera. With a full battery and loaded with blank film I can get about five pictures be fore it starts glitching for no reason. Just spend more money and get a better camera. "  "Not worth it. Kept jamming and blurry "  "Don't waste your money. Don't waste your money it doesn't even stay charged for even for an event. Charged it most the night for my wedding and then it was horrible for the pictures when they did print. "  "Nice idea poor execution. Maybe digital cameras have come on so much from using instant cameras years ago but this is slow noisy very small hard to see pictures. Have given up using it in frustration at low quality. " 
 "No charger. Did not come with charger but not sure how to email or call about this. "  "Decent camera. This product works well as long as it's very steady and in a brightly lit environment. Blurs very easily and colors easily become soft and un-vivid. Also the view port has a frame in it. This is the outermost edge of the photograph. It's pretty small. "  "Please don't buy this. Broke after 1 picture. Wouldn't spit out the pics when it did it was blank used color card and it still didn't work. Spend up for Fuji " 
 "I did not like it at all. It worked for like a day when I tested it out . On the actually day I needed it was not working . I had to send it back . I really wanted to take photos for my daughters 5th birthday "  "Sensitive button on phone.. The button to press taking picture is very sensitive to touch. Because of that there were several pictures taken in error. This waisted paper. Love the quality. Just not happy with the button issue. "  "Quality prints. What I adore with this instant camera is the outcome of the printed images. The quality was amazing--you get nice image crisp great brightness and enough contrast to make the image look fabulous. You get the exact same colors and it's just awesome. But when you print it out you'd be more amazed to know that the camera and the right paper produce smudge-proof print-outs and it has sticky back for you to pin it on surfaces you like. It was as easy as 123 taking photos with it too. All you have to do is point the lens to wherever whatever or whoever and then take the shot. Its wide lens got you covered. " 
 "Cheap cheap cheap. This camera feels so cheap and the pictures are a far cry from the Polaroid snap. Buyer beware. "  "Nope.. I bought a much more affordable Polaroid mini 11 for my 8 yr old niece thinking that one was for a child and this one being more adult.  I would much rather have bought another one like hers for myself. This thing isn't even worth $10 and the film quality is worse. "  "Poor photo quality and prints immediately. Poor photo quality also Prints immediately after taking photo. " 
 "Kids going old school. Bought this for my 11 year old and she loves it I loved that it was more affordable than the polaroid version. Just wish the paper wasn\x92t so expensive because she\x92s a little picture happy and she goes through them like water. The photo quality isn\x92t as great as a regular digital camera but it gives you that old school Polaroid feel "  "My new hobby. I used to have a job where I had to show up to work everyday but now thanks to the pandemic I find myself working at home with a lot more free time on my hands. Took up photography and got a few different cameras this being one of them. I like this one because you can take it with you and print anyplace. " 
 "I dont like it i love it!. I bought it as a Birthday gift for my niece. When i asked her if she likes my gift she said she doesn\x92t like it...she loves it! "  "always wanted one. I think there's something here that wasn't there before this amazing instant print camera! I've always wanted one and now I've got it I rule. I can see myself standing on the corner taking shots of pretty city ladies and handing them to them. Maybe I'll get rejected but if even 1 in a 100 says yes I'm a lucky man. Great quality too. " 
 "This is a terrible camera. I got this for my 13-year-old daughter but the picture quality is so bad she doesn't want to use it. Hard pass on this one. "  "Awful. Buy the instacamera instead. The pictures are terrible. Outside on a beautiful day- the picture is dark and very fuzzy. I bought this for my trip to Spain- so disappointed. Will be returning "  "This camera inspires. Took the instant print camera out for a walk around the neighborhood the first time and I'm glad to say I found new things to take pictures of. It's just amazing what all you can find when you start searching with a camera in your hands. A great camera for inspiring unexpected photos. " 
 "No charger!. Ordered for my daughter for Christmas and there was not enough charge to even take and print a picture. The owners manual says it should come with a charger but it did not. I now see a bunch of comments from the last 2 weeks with the same issue. Very disappointing. No responses from the vendor to fix the issue. Don't buy this camera. "  "Don\x92t waste your time ordering.. No USB cord in package to charge. Very disappointed. "  "It does an ok job. It does an ok job for what it is. I just expected better picture quality from Kodak.  Surprisingly my daughter\x92s Instamax takes a better picture " 
 "Worst !. So embarrassing gave this as a gift to someone.  Nothing but trouble. Very poor quality. Not worth $100. Plastic garbage. Wish I could of returned for a refund. "  "Fun for gatherings. Worked pretty well as described.  Need to charge before using.  Good for kids to have fun at family gatherings. "  "For a memorable holiday. Needed a small instant printer for thanksgiving and christmas this year. Saw this one advertised online and knew it would be a smash hit. I've been trying in out in anticipation of the big day and I'm not in the least bit disappointed. On the contrary I'm sure it will make the holidays more memorable. " 
 "Deceiving description. Has no b&w switch! Has no proper lid for paper instead you get frail one not like in pictures. Only 5 MP camera which looks bad both on paper and digital copy. Tries to print even if you want to save to SD card only without paper. "  "Nope. Bad gift for anniv?The sights don\x92t align with the actual lens color get washed out after the first two shots in a pack of film and it\x92s too expensive to be so worthless?\nPicture quality is terrible.. First time using since I bought it and it\x92s disappointing. Every single picture comes out blurry " 
 " even fully charged.\nI love this little thing. Honestly I love this thing. I use it at my shop with all my clients.\nMother's gift. The kodak printomatic is a perfect first camera gift for anyone interested in photography. I just got one for my teenage daugther "  " I wanted her to have something tangible she could share with friends besides photos on social media over the phone. Turns out she really got into it and loves shooting and printing now. Looks like my gift sparked her interest.\nNot good for youth. Neat idea " 
 " but my 10yr old had a hard time figuring out how to use it and now it just sits in her room.\nLots of fun. I wanted one of these a while back but couldn't afford it. Thankfully "  " my parents lent me some money so I bought it and I'm glad I did. It will really help me start up my photogrpahy business. I'm thinking of starting with a simple collection of small shots and then moving on to something bigger. Should be a lot of fun.\nTake it with you. Loving the printomatic "  " with 25 prints per charge " 
 " it really has just enough for those little trips around the city. I took it to the zoo last week to look at the monkeys "  " what a fun time I had! I got some great shots of the chimps throwing stuff at each other. A great instant print camera you can take with you just about anywhere.\neasy to use. super easy to use but pictures are always blurring and never clear\nSimple and easy to use camera. Bought this as a gift for my gf. She absolutely loved it and uses it all the time. Pic quality isn\x92t the greatest but we weren\x92t expecting the best quality.\nBlur. Every single picture was blur " 
 " pretty bad quality\ntake some getting used to but works well. i like the camera pictures "  " camera works well. fun to use\nGreat camera. The teens love this. Takes great pics\nPiece of crap. Did not like this waste of money used all film and never got a good picture have ordered more film and will try again\nCarry on camera. I was afraid the tsa wouldn't let me take my camera on the flight but once they put it through the scanner and it came out okay they let me. Spend a twelve hour flight getting great looking pics of my fellow passengers " 
 " some of them asleep. Made my flight a lot more interesting!\nGuess I was right. Got the printomatic as a first camera for my son. He's artistic and I thought he should give photography a try. What do you know but he took to it like a fish to water. Now he takes the camera with him everywhere and you would be hard pressed to find him without it these days. I guess I was right when I thought he would enjoy it.\nUnique photos in digital age. You know "  " I'm finally starting to appreciate the worth and unique quality that instant print cameras provide. Sure " 
 " the pictures are small "  " but the benefit is that you can hold the photo in your hands immediately. In an increasingly digital world "  " it's nice to have something to go back to.\nKinda noisy. My camera gets super noisy when I take a photo and you have to stand super still when taking a photo if you don't it comes out a bit blurry.\nCamera in poor condition when delivered. The camera apparently was an open box item although I paid new price amount. It came with no charger. As soon as I took the back off to install printer paper a corner piece of camera broke off. Very disappointed with condition of item. It was a Christmas present for my mother in law so I have no idea how camera actually works\nVery good for a young child.. This is very easy to use.\nI bought this as a gift for 17 year old grand child. So no real experience with outcome.. No complaints\nYou'll thank me. What's great about this instant print camera is that after a week of using it " 
 " I'm still interested. Every time I take it out I find new things to photograph and get excited about. If you've never use it before you won't know what I'm talking about which is why I suggest buying it now before they run out of stock "  " you'll thank me when you do.\nNot that great. I got this for my 4 yr old son. He loves it and doesn't seem to mind the poor image quality. He really likes sticking the photos of his adventures in a journal. I will say that when I try to take photos the quality is mediocre at best.\nAmazing!. Love this camera! Easy to use and pictures come out great! Love that you can change the picture to be color or black&white!\nWaste of $. Don\x92t waste your money! Made like a toy camera " 
 " came with a door that wouldn\x92t shut "  " waste of time & $\ntake it travelling. What a fun camera to take on vacations with you. The family and I went to DC this weekend and I took it along to catch funny moments on the street. I got some real keepers here. One of my wife giving the middle finger to a taxi driver even "  " sorry honey! All joking aside "  " it's a great little camera that's easy to carry "  " you hardly even notice it's in your pocket.\nDo not buy!!!. How should I say this. Well price of crap!\nDO NOT BUY: Dead on Arrival!. Dead Battery " 
 " DO NOT buy!\nnot a great camera. the photo quality is poor. pictures come out blurry with poor color quality. you have to hold still for a long time or they are very blurry. sometimes you click to take a picture and nothing happens so you click it again and then it prints both pictures.\nOk "  " others are better. Each of my kids has a different Instant print camera. The quality of these photos isn't as good as others. All cameras were in a similar price range. Won't buy again\nKodak printomatic. camera was okay it's most likely for young kids.. lighting was okay picture wasn't has i expected but it's good for gifts to kids..\nWorse investment ever. I bought this because i wanted to take pictures of my son\x92s first day of school and this doesn\x92t even come with the charger not the print paper that it says it does this is horrible quality the camera feels super cheap DONT WAIST YOUR MONEY ON THIS IS NOT WORTH IT\nFun camera " 
 " very easy to use but picture quality is horrible!!. This camera is super cute and fun to use. I\x92ve read lots of reviews about the quality of the camera so I expected it to not be so great "  " however I did not expect my pictures to be unrecognizable. The quality of my pictures are horrrible "  " I\x92ve tried multiple lightings and changed settings "  " I\x92ve even checked the photo sheets. I don\x92t know why the quality is so bad but it\x92s upsetting. The camera is still very fun to use but I would only purchase it for a teenager who isn\x92t serious about photography.\nAmatuer photographer. As an amatuer photographer just getting her first start " 
 " I really didn't know the first thing about instant print cameras until a friend showed me theirs. Turns out it was the printomatic and I fell in love with how simple and fun it was and got one for myself "  " now I use it all the time!\nGood product for the price. Great size. Pictures turn out good as long as there is excellent lighting. Perfect for quick fun pictures\nWhat a waste of money. Camera got jammed within 10 minutes of using so we could not use it for the rest of the event we bought it for! Don't waste your money.\nNo charging cord?? What the heck!!. I was excited to receive this product but it came with no charging cord although it says there\x92s one provided. So I can\x92t say much about this product. It\x92s unfortunate. Also the quality of the pics is not that great. Such a disappointing purchase\nabout what i expected " 
 "can be used quickly!. easy enough to set up will use as alternate "  "hurry up pic when hiking "  "quality not as good as my iphone xr!\nSent without a charging cord.. If I could give no stars I would. received this today without a charging cord. I\x92m so disappointed. I don\x92t even understand how that\x92s possible. I can\x92t even turn it on.\nGreat for the price. Pics aren\x92t super great quality "  " but that\x92s part of its retro charm!  I got this for my 13-yo daughter to bring on an extended school trip " 
 " no phones allowed. She and her friends had fun w it!\nNot at all as diacribed this camera is a cheap nock off. We can't get it to take a single picture.\nI like the style. Thought I would try out an instant printer so I did a quick search and came up with this printomatic. I must say it's one of the best camera's I've ever had "  " judging from the fact that I've never had a camera before I guess that's a good assessment. Lightweight build and I like the style too "  " it has its own personality.\nGood quality for the price. Bought it for my 8 years old grandaugher for Christmas and she loves it  " 
 " perfect for what she needs.\nWhy I chose this one. I was wanting an instant print camera for a while but couldn't make up my mind which one to get. I browsed around and came across this one. What stuck out at me was the simple design. I thought I would give it a try and turns out it's the right one for me. Simple yet takes great photos "  " just what I needed.\nEh. The pictures come out cloudy and come out with a slight red tint. The camera itself charges fast but takes its time to take the photos. So yes while the price is convenient I would recommend looking at others\nSo life like. My favorite kind of printer for travelling and carrying around town. Fast to use and helps me get those quick shots fast " 
 " those shots that I would otherwise miss out on. Another thing that I really like about it is how detailed and defined the prints are "  " so lifelike it's startling.\nbiker camera. I had a dream of travelling route 66 on my bike this year "  " and I finally made it a reality last week. I got the printomatic to put in my jacket pocket and snap quick shots when I'm on the bike. A few were a little blurry but most of them turned out great "  " even while going at top speed! This biker boy highly recommends the printomatic.\nFreeing instant relief. I thought for a long time about buying this here camera. I considered other models and weighed the options. In the end " 
 " it was the price and carefree quality that made the decision for me. Now that I'm here with my camera taking photos like the hipster that I was born to be "  " I feel free "  " liberated "  " a weight has been lifted off my shoulders.\ntaking pics in church. I used my new instant print camera to take pictures of sunday worship service at church this week. You really get a better understanding of people when you see them pouring their hearts out to the lord. You can tell whose being honest and who isn't. I can't wait to add these to my collection of pics from last week.\nBad quality. Super Cute and feels sturdy but the photo quality is blurry and super glared. Sad Because I was so excited\nLow cost offset by poor quality.. Thought it might be a good way to expose young kids to photography " 
 " but the pictures it takes are of such low quality that the kids didn't like them.\nQuick photos. Easy to use "  " but not great photos\nBroke first week. Picture quality was rough "  " and it quit working after about 15 pictures.  Charges fully. Didn't help.\nMy full review. Been using this instant print camera for about a week now. Feel confident enough to make a full review. First "  " it's so simple "  " anyone could learn to use it. Second "  " the lens is perfect for instant shots "  " really gets a good wide angle view. Lastly " 
 " it's small and light so you can take it anyplace.\nShe was happy.. She loved it. So that was my reason for getting it for early birthday present.\nPicture perfect. Super cool camera! Love the sticker paper. My daughter prefers this hands down over the Polaroid!\nDid not come with charger and Flash don't work. The picture quality was nice the printing was fast and easy the only complaint I have but the camera itself is The Flash did not work and it did not come with a charger that is why I'm returning it.\nNot great seller. This item is terrible it didn\x92t come with a charger it doesn\x92t have e black white option very disappointed\nBroke after a couple of times use. The quality is really poor and not worth for $50\nMissing USB Cable. Our camera arrived but there was no USB cable in box.  Instructions mentioned provided USB cable as well as item on site.  Can we get the missing cable?  Thanks.\nBad pics. This camera took blurry pictures.\nProfessional photos. As someone who uses and takes photos professionally " 
 " I was at first a little skeptical about the quality. Since I started using it "  " I see that it's a lot better than I expected "  " quite good really. You wouldn't expect it for such a small camera but there you go.\nThe perfect accessory. Really fun design and comes in lots of bold colors that go well with most of my outfits. I guess you could say I'm kind of a special person when it comes to choosing cameras "  " for me they need to go well with the clothes I'm wearing. This one is perfect for them!\nNo cord. Camera DOES NOT come with charge cord. Why sell a product without everything included to keep it running?\nCute design caught my eye. Thought I might go with another instant camera before I saw this one. The cute design really caught my attention. Been using it for a few days now and I think I made the right choice. It's nice because it's a point and shoot camea but has a nice lens on it so you don't have to worry if the shot is in focus.\nDidn\x92t come with a charger or a carry strap. And should have.. Like the camera " 
 " should have come with a charger and a carry strap.\nJust spit out blanks after the first few photos. I bought this camera and a pack of 50 film for a very important family occasion. After the first few photos it just spit out blanks. I reloaded several times but could not get it to work. Expensive and a huge dissapointment!Nina\nPicture quality sucks!!!. Picture quality sucks!!!\nGreat for teens. My son loves the kodak printomatic I got him for his birthday. He's always running around taking photos with his phone and tik toking " 
 " so I thought he should give instant prints a try. He was a little skeptical at first "  " but once he tried it out he was having a blast in no time. A great camera for teenagers.\nStores photos digitally. One thing I really like about the kodak printomatic is that you can store all your photos digitally in the micro sd drive. Other instant print cams I had before didn't have this feature. It's nice to know you can take pics and not worry about losing them later on.\nnice. very nice pictures\nIt does the work for you. One good thing about the kodak printomatic is you really don't have to be an expert to take great photographs with it. The wide angle lens does all the work for you and all you have to do is make sure the lighting is okay " 
 " which is made easier by the automatic flash.\nThe pictures come out as promised. It is a good quality product.  My 8 year old granddaughter loved it and has been very creative with it.\nA new way. I've to to say I'm really impressed by kodak's printomatic instant print camera. Simple yet so effective "  " I couldn't ask for a better one. The photo quality is really something to behold "  " I mean you should see how good they look when you print them out fresh. Really a refreshing way to enjoy photography.\nTakes great unexpected photos. I think that all said this is a good camera to take with you on walks and capture unexpected photo opportunities. Why just the other day I was out and I saw a cute little pug " 
 " I got the best picture of him with my printomatic. Wouldn't have if I didn't take it with me.\nNot consistent in its capabilities. This camera is not consistent in its abilities to take pictures and print. It\x92s very slow and sometimes doesn\x92t even print the picture. I was going to use these for guest books at my wedding. I tested at my bachelorette and was highly disappointed.\nI needs to take pictures. The back doesn\x92t close properly so it won\x92t take pictures. This was a birthday gift and he cannot use it.\nIts ok not happy with Amazon support. Neat little camera for decent picture quality. Very irritated that the camera did not come with a USB charging cord like it was suppose to. Contacted Amazon support they couldn't tell me what cord I need to buy and was offering me a $5 credit.\nTerrible pictures. All of the pictures came out blurry.\nPoorly made broke after a few uses. This camera broke after having it for 3 weeks and only using it a few times.  We are very disappointed.\nArrived Broken. The camera arrived broken. The lens is completely removed off of the camera. I've already used one like it in the past and have loved it. If it weren't broken I would have given it 5 stars.\nExcellent. I love this camara. We are taking so many pictures and they are good quality\nWas a total waste of money. The camera has not be able to take a clear picture " 
 " since arrival.  I was purchasing the Kodak model to back up my Polaroid camera "  " which was getting 'kinky'.  Sometimes it worked "  " and some times not.  The Kodak is a disappointment as it does not take clear pictures.\nNo one will notice. After using several different instant print cameras "  " I've decided that this one is my favorite. Smaller than other devices "  " it's easier to pull and and use fast "  " so small hardly anyone notices it's there "  " perfect for taking photos when you don't want someone noticing.\nSimple to use.. The photos are remarkably clear and you can't beat the instantaneous results.\nNot So Instant Memories. Unless you have a access to a professional lighting setup " 
 " these photos are very disappointing. They're grainy "  " dark "  " smudgy and just sad. It didn't even come with it's own charger. Kodak has lost a little bit of my trust with this product.\nDONT BUY THIS. I bought it and the first one didn\x92t work.Then we exchanged it for one that worked.BUT THAT ONE DIDNT WORK. NEVER BUY THIS WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!!\nCapture the miricle. Yes since I've been using this printomatic instant print camera from kodak I feel that I've completely changed my point of view. You see " 
 " before I was only looking at the picture "  " now I look through the lens. This camera allows me to catch those little moments of miracle that you would otherwise miss in everyday life.\nJust buy a Polaroid. Picture quality is horrible. I\x92ve gone through two packs of paper trying to get a print worthy of keeping and they\x92re all trash. I would return if I still could. If you\x92re looking for an instant print camera "  " just go with your gut and buy a Polaroid.\npictures aint good. very narrow range of lighting where quality is acceptible. pictures aint good.\nWorst Camera Ever!!. Worst camera ever I was really disappointed. Got this for my daughter for Christmas pictures suck doesn\x92t come with charger. Too bad by the time she opened it up I was no longer eligible for a refund <U+0001F612>\nNo more trips to print shop. Well " 
 " no more need to go to the print shop "  " I obviously have everything I need right here in my hands. With this instant printer "  " I can print all my favorite photos in less time than it would take to go to Walmart "  " let me tell you. As long as I stick to two by three inch photos "  " I'll never need to buy another printer again.\nNot a gift for a child. Terrible gift for an eight year old. Expensive film and difficult to use even for an adult.\nCapture the look. Thought it would be difficult to capture the emotions on people's faces with this camera but I wrong " 
 " it really captures the look just like I wanted to. I tried my best and got a good result "  " it was easy with the wide angle lens.\nCreative camera. If you're a creative person like me then you'll love this camera. Prints are great for making collages "  " decor "  " and party invites. Get creative with it!\nI would love to write a review on this .... I would love to write a review on this product if I had received it.  "  "<U+0001F613> Yes I'm sorry to say was a NO SHOW <U+0001F622> SO UPSETTING MY DAUGHTER'S WAS EXPECTING IT<U+0001F625>\nMake new friends. Got this little instant print cam for my daughter and she seems to be enjoying it. She likes taking it to school with her and decorating shots of her friends. So glad that the quarantine is over in our state and my little girl is back in school socializing. A good camera to make new friends with.\nTerrible quality. Prints were inconsistent / misaligned " 
 " with lots of lines from where the printer messed up.\nWaste of money. Cheap. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra $ on an Instax or Polaroid.. Broken after taking one photo. It\x92s cheap "  " lightweight plastic. The internal mechanics broke and would no longer push the film out for printing. Waste of money. (I am not sponsored. I recommend the Instax sq6 or sq10. The image quality is better "  " it\x92s a heaftier camera "  " and it\x92s the recommended camera of Wirecutter.)\nBrightens up my day. Can't stop printing with my printomatic " 
 " who would have known that I could print all day! I'm just so glad about my printomatic "  " it's really brightened up my day. Has enough prints in it for a quick tour around the city "  " I've already got a whole album of central park "  " on to the riverfront with my new printomatic.\nPowerful lens. Small camera has a powerful lens and viewfinder that really let you close in on a good shot. I find it works well indoors and outdoors "  " in all kinds of lighting. The flash helps when dark. All around good camera that you can take with you anywhere.\nVerified. As expected\nA physical photo. Well " 
 " I finally did it. Bought myself an instant print camera. I guess I just got tired of using my phone to take pictures all the time. I needed something real "  " physical that I could touch. These prints are just my style and will go great in my new scrapbook.\nBetter than smart phones. It's hard to put into words just how much I love this camera. It's so much better than taking photos on a smartphone and every time it prints I know I'm getting a quality photograph "  " not just another piece of digital info.\nGood quality. I takes great little pictures " 
 " I take them of my clients when they come in "  " the background color is pretty good but not perfect "  " that is the 4 not 5 star.\nA great camera. Happy I could afford this great little instant print camera. I'm not making much money these days with the recession and everything but I thought this would be a nice little reward for myself for doing well this year. Great photos and easy to carry with you "  " all around a great camera.\nGranddaughter is 10 and loved it. Granddaughter loved it\nNot worth the price. It\x92s not worth the amount of money they charge . I feel like it should have been better quality for the price . Wouldn\x92t recommend it\nPicture quality is terrible.. Don\x92t waste your money\nFaster speeds. When I first got this camera I was afraid I would lose it or my little brother would steal it but nope " 
 " I was able to keep it away from his greedy little hands. Pictures look great and the speed is so fast you'll never know you were even waiting.\nTake pics on the metro. An all in one security camera that takes care of all my security needs. Geofencing "  " sound and motion activated alarms "  " instant video and audio feed "  " it does it all. Now I can make sure none of the neighbors are messing around on my property while on I'm vacation.\nInstant print camera with much value. So much value in this powerful little device " 
 " much more than you would imagine or even consider. In addition to printing photos instantly "  " it saves all of them to a micro sd drive for later use "  " everything you need in an instant print camera.\nOne stop printer. I used to hate waiting in line for hours at the print shop but now that's no longer a problem "  " I can do everything I need to with this amazing instant print camera. Photographs are small but that's how I like them "  " the perfect size for giving friends and family.\ngift. gift for son\nKodak " 
 " downgraded the design?. It doesn't have the black and white option "  " no charging cable "  " it's a different c\xe1mara from any review you are going to find and there is no way to know what you are getting.\nPhotos forever. The best thing about instant print cameras is that you can bring them anywhere and print wherever you are in the world. At home "  " school "  " or on the subway "  " I can take and print amazing looking photos that people will love and I can keep forever.\nQuick shot camera. I've had a good time with the printomatics " 
 " it's really ideal for capturing those quick shots you don't expect to find when you're just wandering around outside aimlessly. I like to keep it on me at all times just in case I run across something interesting.\nDO NOT BUY. Awful quality doesn\x92t work consistently very disappointing these were Christmas gifts\nI take it everywhere. Printomatic is quickly becoming one of my favorite instant printers I must say. It's not just the quality "  " but the style. It's so convenient and fits right in my pocket " 
 " I barely notice it at all. An ideal printer for anyone who doesn't want to pay too much and takes their camera with them everywhere like me.\ngreat gift for middle schoolers. great product for middle schoolers and friends\nPoor quality photo. Hard to know when picture is taken or ready for printing.  All photos came out blurred "  " not centered "  " and under exposed.\nDaughter loves birthday present. My daughter had a birthday coming up so I thought this pink one would make a nice present. She's never had a physical camera before " 
 " she just uses her phone "  " so I didn't know how she would take it. She just loves it and now she takes it everywhere just like her phone "  " taking pics and giving them to friends.\nHorrible quality. The Fuji film one turns out much better... Don't waste your money on this one.Be prepared to be motionless for a few seconds to get a halfway decent pic.\nPiece of junk.. Piece of junk.  I threw it away.  Pictures all yellow and out of focus.  Tried 20 shots and none turned out.  Don't waste your money.\nFalse info on product. My camera is not the same as the one in the pictures.  No charging USB cord either.  Like it said I would get one.  Mine doesnt have the black and white option either  clearly there are the different versions. The one shown and the one you receive.  I am not happy at all.\nWaste of money. Period.. Stopped working after taking TWO photos. Tried resetting tried everything. The two pictures that were printed were so terrible as well. I will only be using fujifilm instax instead. Waste of money.\nZink paper better. No ink cartridges is what sealed the deal for me. I hate changing them and they always get me all dirty and everything " 
 " I just can't stand it. Thankfully this camera uses zero ink technology "  " that way my clothes stay clean. One less thing for mom to worry about.\nKodak real quality. The kodak instant print camera is a really nice one. I had a model from another company but it just didn't have the same high quality that kodak provides. I'm sure we've all been disappointed by brands before but kodak has never let me down. I'll keep using their products till the day I die.\nSimply amazing. So I just got my new printomatic in the mail and I've been trying it out and I have to say it's simply amazing. Probably the best instant print camera I've ever used before. Really don't have much more to say than that " 
 " just impressed is all.\nLove "  " but poor lighting. I love everything about this except the quality of pics it takes. Definitely need to have great lighting while taking the pictures.\nThe printing takes forever and the quality is horrible. Very disappointed. The pictures take almost a minute to come out and the quality is horrible. I owned a Polaroid back in the day which was instant and way better quality. This was a waste of money\nWorked for 1 month... This product was given to my granddaughter on Christmas Day she used it for approximately a week to 2 weeks and then it stopped making pictures. And fortunately she did not tell me until a week ago so I'm not even sure I can get it replaced\nDisappointing. I had purchased this product as a Christmas gift for my daughter " 
 " and after one use the camera is not working\nMy girlfriend loves it!. The print quality is pretty good for this little camera "  " super great gift idea\nComplete trash please don't buy this. This product completely sucks it doesn't come with a charging cord "  " the paper gets stuck while printing and the flash doesn't go off when it has to. Totally disappointed with this purchase.\nCool concept awful picture quality sadly. The camera is super cool looking and the concept is awesome the pictures are super bad quality sadly idk if it\x92s the brand of pictures I got but idk I wouldn\x92t but this again\nFun toy but don't expect much. Fun toy but printed picture quality is lacking.  Good gift for a child wanting to take pictures and marvel at them being printed.\nNo cord cheap material. The camera was missing the charging cable. It looks and feels very cheap. The back is hard to pop on and off " 
 " it gets stuck. I need to find a usb cable to charge it before I can take a pic so I don\x92t know what quality the pictures are yet.\nNever takes a bad photo. What's great about this instant print camera is that you can take stunning photos and print them instantly while saving them at the same time to an sd drive built in the camera itself. This way you'll never lose those beautiful photos at the beach.\nnot as advertised. there's no black and white function "  " no cable to connect to laptop " 
 " and pictures are 5MPX "  " not 10. The listing refers to a much better Kodak camera "  " but what you'll receive is underwhelming to say the least. A scam not worth your money.\ngood for cyclist. As a cyclist "  " I need a camera that can travel and take a beating. The printomatic is it. When I'm putting in 50 mile days on the road "  " I need a camera that won't break down. I love this one. I can print instantly and share photos with my cycling buddies. I never thought taking photos could be so much fun on a bike.\nJust try and find. I thought I had tried all the instant print cameras on the market until I came across this one. It's really something special. What sets it apart from the others is that it combines quality with ease of use. You just try to find me an instant printer that shoots such high quality photos!\nTerrible. Don\x92t waste your money. Really slow to snap a picture. Have to hold camera steady for 5 seconds while it\x92s capturing the image otherwise it will be blurry. It\x92s going to be blurry no matter what.  Very unlike the old Polaroid cameras that were very fun.\ndon't waste your money. if I could give it no stars I would camera came with no charging cord and the photo quality is horrible " 
 " I returned this one and bought the fuji instead\nWorst picture quality. Picture quality is terrible! Everything is dull and faded regardless of the lighting or environment. Would never recommend this camera.\nPictures are always blurry. For the price it\x92s fine and fun but the picture quality is very poor.\nThe picture quality was poor and it barely works from day one. The picture quality was poor and it barely works from day one\nTerrible Quality Prints. I knew the prints on this camera weren't going to be great. But the results were way below what I expected. Its reeeeaally bad. I thought okay washed out kinda grainy sepia photos kinda vintage style (in my head). The result is more pinkish and just not hugely convincing of photos that you'd want to even keep since the quality is so bad. I'm going with instax\nWHY WONT THIS RED LIGHT GO AWAY?. I bought this last year. Within one month it stopped working. I even bought a new photo paper. I spent over $100 for the camera and the photo paper. As you can see " 
 " it put the paper incorrectly "  " and still the red light shows up and the camera won't take pictures. :( Now it's too late for a refund! :((  I wish customer support would help me!!!\nA real photographer. What a great value on a powerful little printer! I'm having such a great time travelling around "  " driving all around "  " looking for the one "  " the one photo that will make it alright again. I'm greatful I got this camera "  " now I can continue my work "  " the work of a lifetime "  " the only work that means anything to me " 
 " photography.\nwhat more could you ask for. what's great about this little instant printer is it has up to twenty five photos per charge so you never run out before you feel like you've done something useful. Plenty of photos and a fast printing speed. What more could you ask for?\nHappy. I like the camera.\nGood for starters. Got this instant camera for my son who just turned 12. I thought it would be a nice way to introduce him to photography. He's still got a lot of growing to do but I know he's having a great time learning the basics with this camera. A good for for starters.\nKool. Cool 2 have kids like and my gf so I'm happy\ngiving memories. I love instant print photos. I think they bring a certain style to photography that's missing these days. If you ask me " 
 " it doesn't get better than sharing photos with the people you love. That's why I bought this camera. Now I can give friends and family the memories they've been missing.\nHigh quality lens. A great instant print camera "  " I see why people like these so much. Unlike my phone "  " it has a high quality lens and takes really detailed photos "  " I can really see the difference. What's more "  " of course I can instantly print cute little pics to hand out to friends and fam.\nDoesn\x92t take good pictures!. Picture quality is horrible.\nEasy to use and quality pictures.. Used this as a guest book for my nieces Bds party. Took pic of guests " 
 " put in scrap book and each wrote their own message to her. Tremendous hit and will be using for a 80th party.\nwaiting time for image to be printed. I like the printing ability of this camera.  I dislike the clarity and size of the developed picture.\nGlad I bought it. One thing that really impresses me about this camera is how simple it is to take pictures with. I've had a few different instant prints before and this one is not only the fastest but the easiest to use. Glad I bought it.\nMany moods to capture. There are many moods in one day and I can capture all of them with my new instant camera. Whatever I'm feeling " 
 " be it happy "  " sad "  " energetic "  " lonely "  " excited "  " the editing software allows me to ge in on the mood and edit my pics just right.\nKids love it. Pictures are fairp\nDon\x92t bother. Awful quality pictures. Jammed the first time. Doesn\x92t come with a charger. I was honestly disappointed. Would definitely like my money back.\nNo charger and blurry photos. It doesn't come with a charger and the photos are blurry.  Would not purchase again.\nSaves time printing. Cool camera comes in so many different colors you wouldn't believe how many photos you can take with it. Up to twenty five in one go " 
 " so much better than the other models out there "  " faster and more efficient "  " saves time.\nNo usb cable provided as advertised- bad batch?. No usb cable provided for 2 cameras delivered 11/2020 .  Amazon says just contact KOdAk . That won\x92t be easy!\nI\x92ll be a repeat gifter on this one. I love this it was so much cheaper and great quality compared to another brand "  " I\x92m buying my niece one now too!!!\nNot great. This thing is kind of garbage. The pictures don't center. The quality is terrible.  The colors are off.\nHorrible picture quality. Purchased this camera for my adventure book. Took one photo that came out terrible so I kept trying. Even tried at night so the flash would turn on but the picture quality is terrible. The only think I like is that the print paper is sticky in the back.\nCompliments from friends. Kodak's new instant print camera the printomatic is a high quality camera despite it's small size. I use it all the time and it always prints photographs that I want to share with others. All my friends compliment me on how great they look.\nNo usb. Didn\x92t come with usb cord I tried calling Kodak directly they said is a third-party item they just use their name on the product. I tried ordering a USB card came today and doesn\x92t fit shaking my head if one person sees his post my devices don\x92t buy this product\nFun Camera to have around- not professional. I took this camera as something fun to take on my trip to Ireland. It was indeed fun and it was hit. I still took tons of pictures on my phone " 
 " but this was something I wanted to take some little photos to put in an album or put on my fridge. It is not a professional camera it is meant to be something fun. I will take on my next adventure.\nLow quality. The pictures are very low quality and come out with a orangish/pinkish tinge and when the flash is on everything is white. But it\x92s to be expected from a cheap camera.\nBad Photo Quality. The photos turned out very blurry and slightly orange. I tried in multiple lightings "  " indoor and out " 
 " they did not turn out as shown in the description.\nMuch more fun. Having a great time using my new printomatic to get the job done fast and efficiently. I tried others instant printers before but this one is top of the line and super easy to use. Makes taking photos less of a chore and much more fun.\nKid friendly. This camera is pretty neat for my little kids! They love that the pictures are sticky! We have a few instax cameras and this one is better!\nA discrete camera. Kodak printomatic is the perfect sized instant printer for me. I can take it with me anywhere and it's small enough to fit in your pocket. Also " 
 " it's very discrete so you can take great photos of people without them even noticing. Really having a great time with it.\nHorrible picture quality. The picture quality is very dissatisfying. I knew it wouldn't be great but it is horrible! I would not advise anyone to buy.\nPoor quality photos. My girlfriend was very disappointed in the quality.\nPerfect - worked for our wedding guest book. Really great photos...surprising. We used for our wedding guest book. Worked great!\nLots of fun. This printomatic from kodak is really a lot of fun. I've been using it for a few days now and let me tell you that it's just great. Who would have known such a small camera could take such high quality pictures! I'll be letting my friends and associates know all about it.\nSharing memories. Such a cute instant print camera " 
 " I can't stop using it. Such fun to snap instant memories with your friends. Here we are at the end of the school year and I know I'm going to miss them a lot. Glad I have the printomatic to share memories with them.\nPrint anywhere. Best thing about this little camera is I'm my own printer now. I don't have to go the print shop or walmart "  " I can just order paper online and print from my home "  " or on the go. Now I see what it means to have the power to print in the palm of your hand. It's quite a revelation to be sure.\nI take it everywhere. I take my kodak printomatic with me most everywhere. It's small enough to fit snug in my front pocket. I just pull it out when I want to use it and it prints automatically. A fun device to have on you at a party.\nGreat camera. Guess who got a new camera? Since I got this thing I just haven't been able to put it down. Taking pictures like I'm andy warhol or something " 
 " for real. Just believe it and feel it and you can take amazing photos "  " great camera.\ncharger. I cant test the camera itself "  " since it didn't come with a charger. This is the reason why I am rating this product low. I ordered it brand new however it failed to come with a charger.\nAll in one camera. A perfect camera for taking instant photos and printing in place. All you have to do is point and shoot "  " the camera does all the work for you. Prints quickly and they look great. Vibrant colors and sticky backs make them great for decorating notebooks.\nPrint anywhere I want. If I never see another print shop again it will be too soon. That's what I said to myself before I had this amazing instant print camera. Now that I have it I can print wherever I am " 
 " so no more waiting in long lines or taking pointless trips.\nthanks mom. My mom got me this camera so I could take and hand out photos of our 4th of July picnic this year. I've been trying it out at home and what a lot of fun it's been. You can really capture those unexpected moments with it. Thanks Mom "  " looks like our picnic will be full of memories this year!\nNever again!. Did not turn on and the ink Cartridges I brought separate didn\x92t fit this camera "  " very disappointed.\nMy top three reasons. If you asked me I would tell you that this is one of my favorite instant print cameras. If you asked me why I would say first because it's easy to use " 
 " second because it doesn't jam "  " and third because the photographs always look amazing.\nOne stop print shop. The nice thing about having a camera like this is it's like having a print shop right there with you wherever you are. Whether I'm at the office "  " at home "  " or travelling "  " I know I can print quality photos in just a few quick seconds.\nNew way to photograph. Finding new ways to take photographs with the printomatic. Works well in all kinds of conditions "  " light "  " dark "  " overcast " 
 " indoors and outdoors. Been trying new filter combinations in the editing software "  " getting some really original photos.\nNo more print shops. I can't tell you what a relief it is not to have to got to print shops all the time like I used to before I had an instant print camera. It's really change my printing experience "  " much easier now. Great camera that has all you need.\nBold colors. Well designed device that comes in bold colors "  " I went with this one because it goes well with my blue eyes and fits my style. I think that's about all I wanted to say " 
 " oh wait "  " it also prints quite fast "  " okay that's all.\nGreat deal on quality camera. What I like about my new kodak printomatic is the size "  " it's so small and compact that I don't even notice when I'm carrying it in my pocket. Pictures look great too "  " and I can't complain about the price. All said "  " it's a great deal on a quality camera\nA print preference. I've always preferred instant print cameras to digital photos. There's just something about holding a real print in your hands that gives you a different perspective. Also they look more authentic. Even small photos like these look great.\nPicture quality is horrible. Super blurry with a white line through the center. This was a gift for my niece. Easy to use but really horrible picture quality\nThe fastest instant print camera. I've never used such a fast camera before. Really " 
 " it's ready to take pictures as soon as you turn it on. There's no need to wait for it to power on or anything like that "  " it's the fastest instant print camera I've ever used.\nBroken. Broke after about 8 pics sent back.\nAn upgrade from disposable cameras. I think this new generation of instant print cameras is really superior to its disposable predecessors. Unlike disposable cameras "  " you can use these for a lifetime and all your photos are saved on a micro sd card so you can choose which ones to keep.\nDoes not work " 
 " will not take pics "  " no charger. Absolutely the worst camera ever !! Do not buy\nJust my style. Cool camera "  " available in many different colors "  " each as unique as the person who made them. If you ask me "  " there's nothing quite like aqua blue "  " so I went with it instead of the other colors. Perfectly fits my style and mood.\nOrdered for 7year old in august for  Christmas.  Flash doesn\x92t work so only blurry pics.. Flash did not work so indoor pic blurry and dark.  Purchased in August for Christmas so no Amazon return and no warranty information in manual.\nNot worth the money. The photos were great " 
 " but the camera wouldn\x92t stay charged and about half way through our shower it quit working so half of our guest book has photos and half doesn\x92t. Would t recommend or buy again.\na good investment for a 9 year old. My girl loves it! It was her Christmas gift. Although the printing paper is only found on Amazon "  " still "  " a good investment for a 9 year old.\nPics make great gifts. So much fun using a cool instant print cam like the printomatic. With cell phones you can't give your friends real photographs " 
 " just digital ones. I think people appreciate real photographs more today than before. They make great gifts for your friends.\nJammed. It\x92s cute and everything but it jammed immediately and we can absolutely not fix it.\nDoesn't work often. It's cute when it works but I've gone through more film because maybe one will print from the pack. Shame.\nIt's okay. Pictures aren't the best but my son has fun so that's all that matters\nBoth not good.. The film is supposed to adjust the color to correctness.  Not so much " 
 " pictures come put with a pink ting. And when you center the camera pn the object "  " picture comes out off "  " part cut off "  " off center.  Both not good.\ntotal printing control. I guess I can kiss my trips to the print shop goodbye with this little camera. It's such a blessing to be able to point "  " shoot "  " and print in one go. Best of all "  " I can print from the palm of my hand. The printer is in my hands now "  " not the print shops "  " total control.\nLas fotos sales borrosas. Las fotos no son de buena calidad\n. Las fotos no son de buena calidad\nTake it anywhere. If I had to compare this camera to other instant prints I would give it ten out of ten points. When it comes to simplicity and ease of use it just can't be beat. What's more " 
 " it looks great "  " just love the cute design. So small you can fit in your pocket. Take it with you anywhere!\nTerrible - Absolutely Terrible. Every single picture comes out blurry. Just a terrible product. Honestly "  " do yourself a favor and save your money or buy something else.\ngreat fun. I love the camera I do weddings and we set up a photo booth and guests have a ball with itIts a little slow but does the job great\nPictures. Love it and works great!\nPictures don't print out clear. The pictures don't even print. We've tried collaborating " 
 " resetting "  " different lights "  " no flash "  " flash "  " color "  " black and white. Ordered a replacement "  " I hope the next one works!\nNo charger doesn\x92t turn on. Doesn\x92t come with charger. Its doesn\x92t turn on\nInstant Badness. The quality of photograph is horrible. Even if your subject is 18 inches away.Kodak name doesn\x92t translate to quality in this case!\nFun device. Really fun device and great to take with you camping. Took it out to the woods for a few days this weekend and it held up great in the bad weather. It rained but that didn't stop it from taking and printing beautiful pics I gave to my friends.\nOn the go pics. I've always been a bit of a photographer but never have I ever fell in love with a camera like I have with this one. One of a kind " 
 " great lens "  " super portable "  " and prints in just a few seconds. Ideal for on the go pics.\nTop of the line. The kodak printomatic is my one stop printer. It really takes care of all my printing and photo needs. All you have to do is point and shoot and you get great looking photos in just a few short moments. Top of the line.\nLike taking pics with camera. Lots of people now only use their phones and refuse to take pictures with other devices. I don't want to be like the rest of society so I opted for buying an instant print camera. I chose this one for it's size and portability.\nDefinitely not worth time or money. This camera doesn't work. I got two and for both the paper print error came on and never went off. I read all directions and troubleshooting advice. I don't recommend this camera. Hassle to return.\nTerrible picture quality. Very slow printing. Bought for 9 yo as Christmas gift. Already own a fugi instamax (way superior product " 
 " btw) and wanted something different. Wish I could return but alas "  " child loves it "  " despite the terrible quality pictures.  Sub-par product and waste of money.\nTake it everywhere. Having a great time with my kodak printomatic "  " so conveniently sized I take it with me just about everywhere I go. I used to think that I could just use my smartphone but I'm discovering that I enjoy physical photographs much better. There's just so much more you can do with them.\nLove it. When I heard Kodak was coming out with a tiny " 
 " universal instant camera I was so excited! I have some of their earlier models and I get a lot of great pictures with them. But most of all "  " they're lots of fun to use. Has great value for all it offers. I love it.\nEasy use camera. Convenient to use and carry for trip or at family gathering. Only down side is cost of film. Perfect for teens or adults.\nRegular. La calidad fotograf\xeda es regular en general es bonita pero no vale mucho la pena\n. La calidad fotograf\xeda es regular en general es bonita pero no vale mucho la pena\nNo charger included!. I can\x92t speak to the photo quality as I gifted these to my nieces. But was disappointed when they opened them and weren\x92t able to use them. They did NOT come with a charger for the camera. The instructions in the box indicate to use the INCLUDED cable to charge.\nGreat value. Instant camera is one of the best and most fun I've used in a long time. Most cameras these days are so complicated but this one really takes it back to the basics with photography. Lots of modern features included in this small device.\nClick and print. Never had a camera that's so easy to use. I just click and it prints out a stunning photo automatically. So nice to just print wherever I am and whenever I feel like it. It's much better than having to go to the print shop all the time.\nTangible photos. Got tired of just having digital photographs on my phone so thought I'd try an instant printer. I'm really loving the printomatic. It's nice to have tangible photographs that you can use for all kinds of projects.\nfaster printing. lots to do with my new instant print camera that I had no idea how to do earlier. Like take and prints photos on the go without wasting time. No time wasted with this camera " 
 " prints faster than any other I've used.\nWould buy again. Have to say that this is a usefull instant print camera and you can do just about any camera tasks with it. Takes fast photos and prins easily. No ink or mess "  " just clean prints. Easy to use and I would buy it again.\nAwesome. Picture quality\nSimplicity. What I like about the printomatic is its simplicity. Cameras don't get much simpler than this and for good reason. I can take photos with ease and not worry if they're perfect or not. A fun camera for when you just want to take pictures.\nToo good to pass up. I'll just go out on a limb here and say it " 
 " the kodak printomatic is the best instant print camera I've ever used "  " bar none. It's ease of use is what makes it so great and exceptional. Combined with high quality prints "  " it's a deal that's just too good to pass up.\nBetter in all aspects. There is so much I could say about this camera that would impress you but I'll keep my compliments limited for brevity's sake. It simply is much better quality than other instant print camera's I've use before "  " in all aspects.\ntake it with you. I've never had more fun with a camera " 
 " honest. Since I can take it anywhere "  " I'm finding opportunities to take photos in places I would have never thought of before "  " like the ladies room for example. Just joking. But seriously "  " you can take this thing with you anywhere.\nNice "  " fun little camera. Nice "  " fun little camera.  The pictures are okay "  " of course the pictures aren't like a regular camera but they are fun.  Im buying 2 more for my grandkids this Christmas\nHandy camera. A very simple camera but handy in a pinch. I've used it for a few days and it prints fast and easy every time " 
 " I'm enjoying it. Has a micro sd card too so you can save all photos for later and print them again in different formats.\nNew instant printer. Bought myself the printomatic because well I just can't get enough of great kodak products. I mean all my cameras are kodaks and now I'm thinking that this might be the best instant one I've tried. Such great looking prints and convenient to take with you "  " i recommend it.\nJust like me. Never thought I would find a camera that really expressed me and my character " 
 " then I came across this one and after using it knew it was just right for me. Like me it's a carefree "  " easygoing device that's easy to use.\nFun for all ages. The printomatic is an intuitive camera that makes photography both fun and simple. A great starter camera for young photographers "  " I got it for my daughter and she's already taking it with her wherever she goes.\nDisappointed. Bought this for my daughter rather than the instax. Wish I would've bought her the Instax instead. This does not print pictures well and it doesn't always print after you take a picture.\nFun for parties. Great quality for Polaroid. Super fun for parties! Make sure to wait and not touch the photo until they fully develop.\nLove the design. My experience using this instant camera has been great so far. For me " 
 " esthetics are very important and this printer is particularly well designed and chique. I take it with me everywhere I think it looks so good.\nLooks modern "  " functions worse than the originals. Pictures turn out dull and curl up when printed. Already replaced with an Instax mini 90 and much happier with the picture quality\ngreat for decorating. What's great about this camera "  " besides the fact that it's so easy to use "  " is that the pictures it takes are small enough to scrapbook and decorate with. They have sticky backs too so you can stick them anyplace. A great camera for decorating.\nGreat looking pics. How many times have I been disappointed by instant print cameras? Too many to count. The kodak printomatic is a different experience altogether " 
 " so simple to use a child could operate it "  " I always get great looking pics with it "  " wherever I am.\nEase of use. What makes this instant printer so much better than others is it's ease of use. Optical viewfinder lets you find your shot naturally "  " and the wide lens takes in panoramic shots for perfect views. It doesn't get any easier than this.\nDidn't work. The photo quality is poor\nHorrible. Pictures where horrible "  " I would not purchase this instant camera\nGood product. Good product\nsad it didn\x92t work. it didn\x92t even work after the 1st pic. had to get a refund :(\nHelp?. I can\x92t charge the camera " 
 " there is no charging chord.\nMissing charger/line through photo. Wanted to love it!This was a Christmas gift for our ten year old and every picture printed with lines through it. Also came without a usb cord to charge. <U+0001F629>\nSimple interface. Having a great experience using the printomatic. It's has a simple interface that let's you point and shoot without worrying about all the extra details. Very simple yet camera yet shoots good looking photos. Well worth the money I spent on it.\nGood product. Is a great product but mine did come with black and white option nor a charging core " 
 " apparently I received a different version of the product "  " not the one that was offered.\nInk jammed. It stopped working and the paper ink kept getting stuck. I want a new one or a refund for this purchase\nPhotos in an instant. The kodak printomatic is so much fun "  " I really wish I had bought it sooner and started using it. I see now how easy it is to use and all I can do with it. Take it anywhere and get quality photos in an instant.\nMy personal print shop. You could say I have my very own personal print shop now with this instant print camera. It takes high quality photos and prints them instantly. Plus it saves all photos digitally. No more trips to the print shop " 
 " I've got mine right here.\nBad light adjustment. I wouldnt say its a bad camera but wasnt pleased with the camera it wouldn't adjust for the lighting so the photos would come out in an orange tint. ( I checked to make sure it wasn't the film but they had the same color on my computer after I took the sd out)\nIt does it all. This is a great little instant print camera and I use it all the time. You should just see me about town holding this powerful device in my hands. There's really nothing I can't do with it " 
 " I can print "  " shoot "  " and print again. Love it.\nBad quality use for this camera.. When I use the camera it takes long to print or it doesn\x92t print at all.. sometimes the print paper gets stuck and never comes out ... I flip the photo paper and it does the same thing. So it has very bad print quality... and picture quality.\nIt broke right away. I only got to use it about twice. Now my photos are all blurry and ugly. Feels like a waste of money\nPictures not clear. Not clear\nCamera stopped working.. This camera stopped working in February. Only lasted 2 months after I gifted it on Christmas to my granddaughter. Even when fully charged it beeps\nFor my boy. Good beginner's camera. I bought it for my twelve year old boy who's just started taking an interest in photography. I know he'll do great once he gets older. He loves it and won't stop taking photos of me!\nGood paper. Love using my new instant print camera. It's so easy to use and the paper is quite high quality " 
 " much better than I was expecting. Pics are looking good and feel good in your hands and don't leave a stain or mess.\nSad!. Pictures suck!\nPrint from home. I always hated going to the print shop. With covid it seems like more and more people are staying indoors and not going to public places like stores anymore. This camera is a great way to stay safe and print from home.\nFun times. Getting so much value out of my new printomatic it's kind of scary! Guess I'll have just enough time to print for Halloween and hand out spooky photos to the little kids " 
 " along with candy of course! Fun times!\nIt came broken!!!. It came broken <U+0001F61E>\nOut in the world. Good instant print camera and very resistant to water and tearing and any kind of damage. I love using it "  " it's simple and takes wonderful photographs. You never know what you'll find out there in the world.\nSuperior quality. Point and shoot camera does a lot to make every photo pop out and look amazing like they should. I've never been happier with an instant print camera "  " it really has superior photo quality despite its small size.\nJust right for me. Wow what a fantastic little instant print camera. I never thought I would find one that was just right for me but I guess I did. Small enough to take with my anywhere and holds a lot of pics in the micro sd storage.\nIs a Christmas gift. Packaged nice\nFound what I needed. I needed a camera I could take with me but print from. Turns out there are these things called instant printers that do just that. I looked around and found this one. It's really great " 
 " shoots high quality photos and prints instantly "  " just like the same says.\ncarefree camera. Cute camera. Easy to use "  " just point and shoot and out comes a photo. I like this kind of camera "  " let's you just enjoy the moment and not worry about how the picture will turn out or if it's the ideal lighting. What you see is what you get. A really fun "  " carefree way to enjoy photography.\nBad. Picture quality sucks and print quality eaqually as bad doesn\x92t smudge.\nPrints fast no mess. Love the kodak printomatic and how easy it is to use. Comes with zero ink paper " 
 " that means no annoying cartridges or ink or all that stuff. Just easy to install zink paper that prints fast and doesn't make a mess.\nExcellent camera. I've been through quite a few instant printers in my day but this one is one of the best. You can imagine why I was surprised when I was able to take such excellent photos. I thought instant printers only had sub par cameras on them but this one is excellent.\nArrived broken. Very disappointed! The camera arrived broken and cracked. So it is unusable! Would expect a full refund but have not had my emails responded to!\nAverage. Not that great.Picture quality is very average and sometimes photo print got stuck. But my daughter had fun on using it.\nNo charger. Didn\x92t come with a charger also the picture quality is lower than what\x92s shown in the pictures\nFor the little photographer in my life. Bought this camera for the little photographer in my life " 
 " aka my 10 year old boy who just loves to take photos. He was spending too much time on his smartphone so I thought this would be a good way to get him taking photos.\nit was flimsy. It prints OK pictures but it\x92s like cheap because everything kind of started falling apart after two days\nDoesnt work for more than a few pictures. I will never buy another product without a screen that can display diagnostics. This thing never works and I have to google to find out what the flashing light means. What a piece of junk.\nJust okay. I didn't get a charger cord with the camera or a strap handle. disappointing\nCute. The Picture quality is poor. My film paper jammed. I pulled it out with tweezers and haven't had the problem again. I put it in a fabric case in my purse and it kept turning on.\nTerrible print color !. All the photos printed in an orange tone!! There is also no way to pr view the photo before printing so a lot of the photo paper gets wasted. We did not like this camera at all!\nGood gift. The film is pricey but this is a good gift for kids.\nDisappointing in everyway. Sadly I bought two as gifts. Poor quality in everyway. Very disappointing from a reputable company\nKeeps on working. Such instant value is hard to find these days. Thankfully " 
 " what we have here is a powerful instant print camera that doesn't power down when things get tough but keeps on working right through to the end.\nBuyers beware there\x92s no charging chord. I was so excited for this camera we going to take it on vacation but now we\x92ll have to return it because it didn\x92t come with a charger\nTerrible photos. Takes blurry pictures and no zoom.\nDon\x92t buy!!!!. Don\x92t waste your time and money on this they turned out red and blurry\nDo not buy! Crap quality!. Took awful photos (blurry and yellowish tint). You can hold the camera so still and it still prints blurry. Had to send back " 
 " not worth it at all.\nBehind the lens. As a fan of instant printers "  " I think this camera is top notch. It's simplicity is it's strength. So easy to use "  " why my 4 year old could even use it. Now that I've spent some time behind the lens "  " I'm beginning to appreciate just what a special little device it is.\nWorks in the great outdoors. A good camera to travel with and use outdoors. I've used it in all kinds of weather "  " wind "  " rain "  " cold "  " and it's held up just fine. Keep printing colorful " 
 " vibrant photos with no problems.\nhorrible.. it was horrible. thing kept getting jammed i wanted me and my girls to use it the other night and the dang thing only printed one picture. i wanted this cuz it\x92s indies and i saw it on tik tok. don\x92t waste your money.\nGreat value. A great value for all this little camera can do. Prints instantly and saves all photos to micro sd card so you can edit them if you like or enlarge the size. Prints look amazing. Well worth it.\nA high rating. My thoughts on the kodak printomatic are highly positive. I'm impressed with the simple design and ease of use " 
 " and of course the photo quality is amazing for such a small device. I give it a very high rating.\nCheap - don\x92t waste your $$. Very flimsy - wish I went with the instapic. The flash only occasionally works. Processor is slow. Picture quality is incredibly low. My daughter was so excited to get this for Christmas until she actually tried it. Don\x92t waste your money.\nGift. This was bought as a Christmas gift. No rating yet.\nNot worth it. Pictures are blurry  "  " the 90s phone camera took better photos.And stopped working after third photo.Can\x92t return camera waste of money.\nAll-in-one printing goodness. The black and white printing feature can be selected instead of colored and I must say " 
 " I like how the images were printed; the tone "  " shadow "  " and overall image crisp were amazing. It's so chic and elegant altogether. The wide angle lens allowed me to take shots like a pro--or at least how I see it. I'm quite biased "  " I know. I didn't have a hard time using it at all. I'm thinking of gifting this to my niece who loves black and white printing as well.\nBlurry. Pictures are more distorted than I thought...even for a kids camera.\nPoint and shoot. This camera is well made and has a simple point and shoot method so anyone can learn to use it. Automatic flash and classic viewfinder. Stores all photos to digital for later as well as prints in a few seconds. Great camera.\nSomething special. Really something special " 
 " this instant print camera from kodak takes wonderful photographs and is light and small enough to carry it your front pocket. An ingenious little piece of engineering.\nBuy extra film. It is the cutest and coolest thing just with I got the back with film also it only came with a couple\nEh not up to snuff. Horrible print quality even for a polaroid.\nPerfect instant camera. Excellent quick shots "  " superior color "  " greasy when a \x93real?photo is needed immediately!\nPicture quality was absolutely horrible. very light weight and cheap feeling. picture quality was terrible. returned it.\nSimple design and use. Fun camera. Simple design and anyone can use it " 
 " even my five year old. She just started talking an now she told me she wants a camera of her own "  " slow down there girl "  " I think you should wait a couple years first!\nSharing photos with grandkids. Glad I bought the printomatic instead of another model. I'm not great with technology but this camera is simple enough for even me to use. Love the instant prints "  " that way I can share them with my grandchildren.\nPoor product. Kodak should be ashamed to sell this. Picture quality is poor. Camera poorly made.\nBig bonus. Using my new printomatic is a real joy. I got bored just using my phone all the time to takes pictures. Now that i have this instant printer not only can I take photos but I can also print where I like. Big bonus.\nWalk and photograph. Fun instant cam " 
 " I like to take it on walks and see what I can find. Oftentimes the best photos are the least expected. You'd never believe all the lovely sights there are in your own town when you just start taking photos.\nJammed after early use "  " now junk. Paper jams super easily "  " but unjamming is near-impossible without ruining the camera. Useless\nDurable. Lots of instant cameras are fragile and break if you drop them or are a little rough. Not this one "  " it really holds up well and I can say with confidence that it works well " 
 " even if you drop it by mistake.\nNo charging cord! Had to get one and three sheets of paper and it\x92s a Polaroid camera?. Disliked no charging cord. Have to buy your own\nSmall but high quality. Cameras have always held a special place in my heart. They can unite us by taking beautiful pictures that move us emotionally and spiritually. This camera is no exception. The photos it takes are very high quality "  " even though it's a small device.\nSo many prints per charge. So many prints per charge you would think this is a larger printer. So far I've been able to print a lot and have no ruined or damaged prints. So nice to print and get a good result immediately.\nA fun camera. Have lots of cameras but the printomatic is one of my favorites because it's so easy to use. Really takes the work out of photography and makes it something fun and enjoyable.\nArts and crafts. The perfect camera for making arts and crafts. Prints small 2x3 photos with sticky backs for easy application on my home decor items.

All I have to do is refill the paper and I can print again instantly.\nPics not as clear as advertised. The camera is cute and easy to use. However the pictures are not as clean and clear as I expected.\nThe button must require more pressure for picture taking. Otherwise your snapping without knowing:(.

Missing the charger and the box that the camera came in looked like it was previously opened.\nHorrible. The camera I ordered didn\x92t even come correctly. Missing buttons " 
 " no b&w/color switch "  " the photos printed out horribly. I was so excited to take pictures with this in the summer. It was absolutely terrible.\nNot worth your money. This camera looks great "  " but it is a terrible camera. It does nothing right. The digital pictures are bad. The printouts are bad. The shutter button is way to easy to trigger by accident. Anyway "  " I bought it for my 6 year old as a Christmas present to get him into photography. Even he is getting frustrated with it...\nSuch a fun camera. Never had an instant print camera before but now I'm seeing why people enjoy them so much " 
 " they're just so easy to use "  " it's more like fun and less like photography honestly. I think anyone would get a kick out of it.\nGreat for newcomers. I was late to learn photography and slow to start using instant print cameras but since I have I'm happy I chose this one. Simple to use "  " zink paper is excellent "  " and photos look better than the original.\nBest value. I asked myself if this was a good buy and reviewed all the other options before purchasing. In my opinion "  " this camera is the best value for your money when compared to other models.\nJust buy a regular digital camera. Came with moisture inside it. Pictures look like they're from 1975. It was a Santa gift to my daughter so I can't return it. Just buy a regular digital camera......\nBad picture quality. Almost impossible to get a good picture . I would return it if I could . I found out the hard way it would of been better to spend a little more money for better quality\nDefective. This item did not work as described whatsoever.\nDon\x92t buy this. This camera is cheaply made & stopped working before my son even got 5 pictures out. The film kept getting stuck & no picture came out.\nNot good. After printing two pictures it now won\x92t work. When I turn it on it makes a running noise and then a red light starts flashing.\nPerfect sized photos. Two by three inch photos are perfect size for all I need to do when I'm out and about. No ink cartridges or any of that " 
 " zero ink paper allows me to print and not care about a mess.\nFun camera. My first instant print camera I'm really having fun with it. I can see how people can become addicted to these things "  " they're so easy to use and seeing a fresh picture instantly is the best part.\nDaughter loved it!!. Great product.

I know I should have bought one earlier but I wanted to make sure it was the right one. Now I have it and I'm so glad I do.\nSo much to do with it. Never had such a fun instant print camera! There is so much you can do with it. Print " 
 " paste "  " decorate notebooks and whatnot. Photographs are top of the line. I think it's an excellent camera for general use.\nNot what I ordered. I have ordered this camera 3 times. The first one was like the description. The second and third one has no option to change to black and white or color. Both have not come with a charger!Not description at all!\nDoubt buy.

It only takes a few seconds to power on and less than a minute to print a beautiful "  " stunning photograph.\nFive Stars. Great product...exceeded my expectations.Hint: Learn how to work it . It might take a couple of tries.\nPoor photo quality. The photo quality is really poor. The colors in the photos aren\x92t accurate and they are grainy.\nPrint where you are.

 " so it doesn't leave stains or any dirty traces. Great stuff.\nParty camera. Great camera for taking to parties "  " it's so small no one even notices it's there. Even thought it's small the photos are high quality. I think the prints are an ideal size for scrapbooking or giving to friends as a keepsake.\nThe lens is what does it. We've been using our new printomatic from kodak for our family vacation this year and we've got to admit "  " we're really impressed. The design is simple yet the high quality wide lens lends great photos for this format.\nsimple. hola comence a probar la maquina.. no puedo decir que es fantastica la calidad de imagen.. supongo que tendre que probar muuuucho.. pero es bueno tener una foto inmediata en papel.\n. hola comence a probar la maquina.. no puedo decir que es fantastica la calidad de imagen.. supongo que tendre que probar muuuucho.. pero es bueno tener una foto inmediata en papel.\nNice try. The pictures weren't clear. I returned all that I purchased as a gift.  It's a good concept " 
 " but poorly executed.\nGreat idea. Nice having a camera that prints as well as takes pictures. Before I just had a basic camera that didn't print and a desktop printer. This one is a combination of the two. Great idea.\nAutomatic flash. This is one of the best instant cameras I've tried. So easy to use it does all the focusing for you. Automatic flash so you'll never have a dark photo. Great all around kind of camera.\nPerfect for me. So after trying many different cameras I finally found the right one for me.

No longer works!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\ncharger is not included?. charger is not included which is very unconvenient since I dont own one!\nGreat product. Great product but upgrade to the one with a screen i bought this one before i saw the other will definitely upgrade. Such a cute little camera\nPoor quality. Pictures turned out terrible\nIts okay.. Photo quality looks the same as the first flip phones.\nBroken camera. After like two uses the on button broke and I can no longer use it. Really disappointing\nFind an alternative before you buy these. The picture quality is terrible\nNot worth the trouble. Pictures come out blurry at times because the button is so sensitive it takes pictures before the appropriate time.\nThat look.

Making so many new memories with the printomatic. Can't believe it prints such good looking pictures. I thought it's size would decrease the picture quality but I was wrong about that one.\nBut this is a fun gift for my dad it was broken two days and he\x92s very careful poor quality. But this is a fun gift for my dad it was broken two days and he\x92s very careful poor quality\nCute camera " 
 " but doesn\x92t function like it should.. The picture quality is not that great. The film also keeps jamming inside the camera.  It will print out a picture or two and then gets jammed. Wish we would have went with a different camera.\nGreat for sharing with friends. A great way to share photos with my friends. We're having a good time scrapbooking and the adhesive on the back of the pictures makes it easy to paste them wherever you like. A  great camera to take to school with you.\nPerfect function.

The sticky backs are really helpful " 
 " I can stick them wherever I want "  " like on my laptop "  " notebooks "  " fridge "  " I just love to stick.\nMisleading advertising.

We through away the original packaging "  " but hope to return it.\nAll my photos in one place. Well I guess I can forget about using my old dinosaur of a computer "  " now that I have the printomatic " 
 " all my photos are here in one place. Convenient to use and prints always come out looking great. I can even stick them to my refridgerator door!\nPicture Quality (Low). The picture quality is not very good at all. I would honestly not recommend this for an instant print camera there are better ones on the market.\nNew favorite camera. I've never taken so many pictures in my life. Since I got the printomatic all I want to do is shoot pics and print off my cute lil images. So glad Kodak made this one. Easy to use.

 " click and print "  " with an instant camera like this one you really can't go wrong. Simplicity is the name of the game and no one does it better than kodak with its printomatic.\nMaking instant memories. Not many cameras let you make instant memories.

 " a really excellent instant print camera.\nfun pass time. I've been snapping away all day on my new instant print camera! I never knew taking pics could be so addicting. It's one thing to take them on your phone "  " but something else to be able to print automatically. Very enjoyable pass-time.\nShould come with a battery attachment!!. Should come with a battery attachment!!!\nGift. Christmas gift for my daughter. looks awesome\nFor my dad. For my dad to take to Mexico he loves it\nNo charger included as advertised. Did not come with charger.\nGood lens. I've had a good experience with the printomatic so far. Has a wide angle lens and sensor to capture all kinds of shots. Makes taking pictures a lot more fun and less of a chore.\nSimple and effective. The printomatic is a great camera and very easy to use. I've been using it for the past week now and always get a lot of cute picks with it. Simple and effective camera.\nBlack and white great. Do not buy  in color doesn't take good pictures at all on black and white amazing details <U+0001F926><U+200D><U+2640><U+FE0F> pay the extra price for a camera this is the type you take if traveling\nDigital storage space. Just picked up my printomatic from the post box and started playing with it. Just as advertised " 
 " it's so simple to use. Has plenty of space for digital storage too if you don't want to instant print.\nDon\x92t like. Didn\x92t like\nOne stop solution. Wide angle f2 lens perfectly captures all you could ever want to photograph with this powerful little instant print camera. A true one stop solution to all my printing issues.\nPoor printing quality.. Haven't had the flash go off no matter the lighting. Picture color comes out with red tint unless outdoors in daylight. Film often gets stuck coming out and leaves a white border at the end.\nSimple yet impressive. Compared to other instant cameras this one is very simple but that doesn't mean it's not well made or prints great looking photos. Wide angle lens let's you capture the moments you thought you were missing.\nNO CHARGER. Does not come with a charger! Nowadays including chargers with electronics is ubiquitous. It\x92s insane this doesn\x92t come with one.\nDurable camera. Tough " 
 " durable little camera that can take lots of abuse. I left it out in the rain and it still works fine. A great camera to take with you hiking or camping.\nGo-to camera. Getting lots of cute little pics with my new printomatic. The perfect size for carrying with you. Capable of taking beautiful photographs despite it's size "  " it's my go to camera for parties and informal gatherings.\nGood starter camera. A good starter camera for beginning photographers. Basic interface makes it easy to use. Capable of both digitial storage and analog printing. What we all want in a printer.\nCharger not included. How you sell an electronic without a charger is beyond me. Really sad my kid got a gift she couldn't use for Christmas.\nSaves all photos to sdcard. Such a superior instant camera " 
 " has all you could need to take quality pictures at the push of a button. Photographs come out looking fresh and new "  " and it also saves all photos to a microSD card.\nDied after a couple pictures. I bought this for our wedding guest book.I tired it and worked great. It made it to at least 6 pictures before jamming.I have not been able to make it work or find a place where they can fix it. It did not serve the purpose and now I am stuck with a useless device jammed and unfixable....\nPrinting easy. As far as instant print cameras go " 
 " this one from kodak is top of the line. I just tried it out for the first time today and it prints with no problems at all. I like the zero ink printing paper "  " makes printing a whole lot easier.\nDoes not include charging cable as advertised. Did not include charger cable or base as stated in papers that were included with cameraSent messages but no reply\nI recommend it. Been carrying my new camera around with me everywhere since I got it in the mail. Works great. Easy to shoot with and prints quick. I'd recommend it to just about anybody.\nTrust me choose a different product. It printed terrible picturesVery cheap feel to itNot at all what it seems like\nQuality camera. Kodak printomatic is a really special instant camera. The cute design really makes it stand out in a crowd and of course the pictures look beautiful. A good deal on a quality camera.\nThe size doesn't matter. Been using my printomatic on my walks this week and you know you can really take some great looking pictures with it. Size doesn't matter " 
 " the quality and definition are still very high.\nTruly Awful Picture Quality. Photo quality under indoor lighting is worse than my 2003 Motorola Razor. Picture quality is too low for these photos to be cute.\nEasy to use.. Bought this as gift for my 11yo. She\x92s enjoyed it. And it was easy for her to use.\nPrint when I want to. It's a real relief to be able to print what I want "  " when I want to. All I have to do is pull out my little camera and press the button and out comes a picture perfect print.\nColorful prints. The best way to capture and share colorful prints with my friends " 
 " I use it all the time on campus. Everyone appreciates my retro style photos "  " I think they're a lot cooler than digital ones.\nPleased with the overall quality. Easy to use. Picture quality isn\x92t crystal clear but for an automatic camera it\x92s just as expected. The pictures are much more clear if you use a memory card and view them on your computer. Overall I recommend this to anyone looking for an automatic camera "  " no real complaints\nPlenty of photos on a charge. A good camera "  " useful " 
 " has enough prints in one charge for a full night of partying. Took it with me to a house party last weekend and got some great shots of friends having a wonderful time.\nNo charging cable in package!. Gift to teen grandchild\nGift for teen. A great gift for my teen "  " she's really enjoying it. Great camera and nice to see her using something that's not a cellphone or tablet. Kids spend too much time behind the screen these days.\nNot good. Bought 2 of these for our kids and they did not come with a charge cable and they don't work at all. Attempted to take a picture and it doesn't work on both cameras.  Very disappointed\nIf you press the button more than once at a time  " 
 " it will print every photo it took. Picture quality is pretty good. You have to be patient for a few seconds to let the photo print "  " but it will print multiple photos at a time.\n... loves this came in time for christmas packaging was great this is awesome just wish there was more. my daughter loves this came in time for christmas packaging was great this is awesome just wish there was more film\nTerrible quality. The camera takes very low quality photos "  " I would recommend this camera for some under the age of 8 or even 5. Not worth it.\nPoor quality of pictures. Poor quality. The plug did not include :(\nBetter than print shops. Instant print camera does a great job printing beautiful looking photos. So happy with the photo quality and definition " 
 " better than many of the print shops I used to go to in the past.\nOutstanding product. Thanks to Kodak for this outstanding product "  " it really does a great job capturing whatever you shoot. Small and light "  " you can carry it easily. Simple to use "  " takes great photos "  " I'm impressed.\nGreat deal. Amazing quality given the fact that no ink is used. My 6 year old loves it.\n10 out of 10. Never been so happy with an instant print camera. Now I can forget about printing off my old "  " big " 
 " cumbersome computer. Printing has never been easier. Photo quality is nice too. I give the kodak Zink ten out of ten.\nNot worth the money "  " get the Polaroid instead.. Bought for my daughter's birthday "  " takes terrible pictures.\nSmile. Small photos\nEasy and fun. Nice camera. I've been using it out and about the town and getting some cute photos of pedestrians and their dogs. Simple and not at all dirty thank to zero ink paper. Makes printing easy and fun.\nDon\x92t buy.

No need to go someplace to print "  " it does it all.\nWorks easily. seems to be a fuzzy "  " blurry image on photo's.\nBought 3 "  " all are broken after first use. Unfortunately these stop working after the first use and didn't come with all of the included supplies " 
 " for $50 each they should be much higher quality.\nNo charger cord. Does not come with charger cord even though manual says to plug in with provided cord\nZero ink paper better. Love these new lines of instant cameras that come with zero ink paper. Way better than traditional cartridges let me tell you. Up to twenty five prints per paper pack. Never jams. I'm impressed.\nConvenient camera. Cute camera and easy to take with you wherever you go. I take mine with me all the time "  " fits fine in my coat pocket. Easy to power on " 
 " has a wide angle lens to capture most kinds of shots.\nCan't put it down. Ever since I got this camera in the mail I haven't been able to put it down.

This one is just as high quality and excellent as other products of their's I've used in the past. Simple to use and small enough to fit in your pocket.\nDisappointing. The camera works maybe half the time or less. It shoots out blank paper more often than photos. Battery life is short. I thought it would be a fun toy but it\x92s a major disappointment.\nAll I need. My new instant print camera has all I need to take great shots without worrying about the result. Instantly prints premium photos and saves everything to a mini drive. No worries.\ngreat value. as described\nHappy with it. Good instant camera with extra slots and attachments. Neckstrap comes in handy when you need to go hands free. Photos seem to be good quality. I'm happy with it.\nLet the fun begin. As far as i'm concerned " 
 " this is one of the best instant print cameras available. I'm having a great time using it and I'm sure you will too. Buy the printomatic and let the fun begin.\nLow price "  " great device. Surprised such a high quality camera costs so little. It really should be more expensive "  " how do they make their money putting out products like this at such low prices?\nPicture quality.

The quick start guide says to connected provided USB cable into a brand name charger. The box doesn't say that a cable is included.\nPoor quality photos. I received the older model and am not impressed with my purchase "  " didn\x92t realize how poor the quality was until after experimenting with a few photos "  " too late to return now.\nWhen I buy a product I expect everything to be included as advertised.

I think it's awesome to have an instant print camera; however " 
 " until I get used to taking photos in different light settings "  " I'm wondering if the final photo print-out will have a gray look to it.  I've taken three photos and all three are not really colorful.  Directions for camera use did not come with the camera.  I had to find the user manual online and print it out.

Easy to place them wherever you want. Fun times.\ndisappointed. this camera broke same day as using it!locked up and would not print anything\nQuality in print and storage. Quality photos even after saving in mac. I gotta be honest "  " I was quite worried that I won't be able to get the same quality when I only save the images using micro SD or in a computer and not print. But I stand corrected. I even use one photo I took as a background image. This instant camera offers quality wherever you store the images.\nIt\x92s very deceiving. The images look nothing like the real picture.. Pictures when printed are very yellow and blurry " 
 " not worth the money.\nFair. Not great photosEasy to use\nNot very practical and not cheap for pictures with poor quality. The idea is great the execution poor.\nWorks great just not great picture quality.

I wish I read the reviews before I purchased this. It is going in the garbage.\nNot too bad for an instant camera. Instant photos are nice to have. Not the highest quality photos " 
 " but okay for my childrens purpose.\nThe colors compliment one another well. I really like how the yellow compliments the white part of the camera. Those two colors fit together very well! However "  " I wouldn't say that the paper truly is smudge "  " fingerprint "  " and water resistent. Just like any photo "  " it reacts to touch and water. That's nothing new "  " though "  " so I'm still just as careful with it as I am with any other prints.\nDon\x92t buy. Did not like it\nPoint and click. Fast and fun " 
 " simple to use "  " having a blast with this instant camera. Just point and click and it prints right out for you. Loving it.\nNo charger in box.

I have 2 disappointed kids because they did not come with a charger like the instructions clearly state.\nWaste of money.. Pure waste of money.  I wasn\x92t expecting greatness.  But seriously I was expecting something more than blurry two tone photos\nNow that's innovation. The 10MP of the camera was enough to take a representation of a great image that will last as a precious memory. You won't even need worry about carrying a huge polaroid because it has a minimalist concept where the printer is within the camera body. Thus " 
 " a wide angel prints the photo you took using the very same camera. Now that's innovation.\nDoes Not come with a USB cable. I am so disappointed!  The camera did not come with a USB cable fore charging.  My grandson was very disappointed that he could not charge the camera.\nPics are smaller than the original Polaroid cameras from 30 .... Pics are smaller than the original Polaroid cameras from 30 years ago "  " pics come out slower and quality is about same.\nHow well it takes pictures.. I love it for quick photos in the moment\n5. Grand daughter loved it\nDon't Buy!. Bought this for my sons graduation and it doesn't work!! Now I have a camera and film and can't use it!! Not happy!\nWatch a video on how to use it..

Was to small and didn't work right.\nFun product. Take pis\nMess free paper. Simple to use and shoot with. Zero ink paper makes printing much easier and mess free. My girlfriends and I get a kick out of it.\nFive Stars. I absolutely love this camera " 
 " having so much fun with it.\nEven the prints come out looking great!. This is such a cool instant print camera as it is an awesome point-and-shoot camera while it also works as a great printer. In fact "  " I am very impressed with the power of the lens as the photos turn out great. Even the prints come out looking vibrant "  " too!\nLike to play around with it. I've been playing around lots with various light settings because I haven't yet found the best lighting for a solid and more colorful print. However " 
 " I think that I'll get the hang of it with time. Also "  " I'm a big fan of the yellow and white frame of the camera.\nMISSING UBS cable in box- no way to charge it. It cannot be used as it didnt come with the UBS cable  so it is useless as you cant charge it\nIt doesn't disappoint. This instant print camera is very easy to use. I personally am very satisfied with the quality and the size of the photos. The best part "  " though "  " is definitely the price. That's why this camera makes a really wonderful gift. It doesn't disappoint!\nTerrible!. Terrible! My pic got stuck in the camera.  I didn't even manage to get one!\nI never go anywhere without it. I decided to try out this Kodak instant print camera and it has just been wonderful! It is so much fun to take photos with it and I absolutely love that it is able to print out the shots right away. I really love the yellow " 
 " too. I never go anywhere without it!\nTerrible. Photos are terrible I would not recommend this product. Go an buy something else.\nGood for the money. Battery did not stay charged for very long.\nNeck strap helps. Real easy to use camera. Comes with a neck strap so you can leave your hands free. I like it.\nNo charger. This does not come with charger "  " such a disappointment.\nPaper kept jamming after first picture.. Paper kept jamming after first picture was taken. Returned it after that. Very disappointed\nHorrible picture quality. The pictures came out cropped and they were streaky with random lines\nNot worth it. Really not a great camera .. took 5 pics with it then colors were starting to fade ... returned it.\nNo USB charger. False advertisement. I ordered two and neither came with a usb charger! Amazon should stop selling this product.\nHow cool is this printomatic camera. While I enjoy printing high-quality color images " 
 " I also enjoy having black and white photos. It's cool that printomatic has both features. The light sensor makes it convenient to take a photo even in dark places because then the flash will automatically function.\nNot a good camera "  " not good picture "  " doesn't come with a case "  " waste of money. Total junk. No case comes with "  " hardly any picture paper and the picture is horrible.\nPoor Print Quality. Not what I expected from a Kodak product. The photo and print quality are not good.\nBest Polaroid ever!. Love this camera! It\x92s so cute and easy to use\nNo charger. The camera is nice but it didn\x92t come with a charger " 
 " or was mine not included in the package?A\nSuch a great buy. It is so nice to be able to print straight from this camera! I have been using it a lot to make cool collages for my friends and they have really loved their personalized gifts. I have had so much fun playing around with it "  " too! This is such a great buy.\nCamera. This camera did not come with a usb cable like it said! Very disappointed my daughter couldn\x92t even try it out Christmas Day after opening it!\nFun Little Camera. They are definitely not high quality images " 
 " but it is still a fun little camera. I think it's worth the price.\nPrints for decorating. Small 2x3 inch photos are great for decorating my schoolbooks. Sticky backs are easy to peal and stay stuck.\nNice camera. Photos not as clear as expected but great gift for my kiddo.\nGreat kids camera. Got this for my daughter.  She loves it.  She'd think's the pictures are the greatest thing ever.  To me the image print quality is its pretty bad but they aren't claiming 5d mk4 quilt either.\nJunk. Very cheap lt made.  Almost feels like it's a toy camera.  Pictures were fuzzy and couldn't tell when it was actually snapping a shot.  Very disappointed.\nLa c\xe1mara no funciona. Simplemente no carga y por lo tanto jam\xe1s prendi?\n. Simplemente no carga y por lo tanto jam\xe1s prendi?\nI am obsessed with this camera. I am obsessed with this camera. For one "

Very unclear with grey lines going through them. Very disappointing\nGood for fast photos. A good camera for taking quick photos. Automatic flash and optical viewfinder. Easy to use. Prints fast too.\nLa c\xe1mara muy bonita pero las im\xe1genes no son muy n\xedtidas o bonitas. Una l\xe1stima la verdad. La c\xe1mara es bonita pero la resoluci\xf3n o nitidez no es de buena calidad\n. La c\xe1mara es bonita pero la resoluci\xf3n o nitidez no es de buena calidad\nThe micro SD is a lifesaver.

Good little camera for my purposes. There\x92s a bit of a learning curve and pictures are small so you have to get up close to your subject. Overall a good little camera\nIt\x92s horrible quality. You point the camera and it dosent take a photo of what your pointing at\nNot worth it. First time my granddaughter used it the camera jammed!\nVery inexpensive for how great the quality is..

Would not recommend for kids under 10.\nsimple and easy. I know I'm a bit of a camera freak "  " but I just can't get enough of this one! It's so simple "  " just point and shoot and out comes a picture.\nStill fun because you are printing a picture in real time. You cannot use the viewfinder to actually take a photo.

Live and learn.\nTwo Stars. Small pictures not clear\nKind of really bad but still fun. Super disappointed in the picture quality. Definitely had to adjust my expectations. The image quality is more like an HP deskjet printer from 2002 even on the tiny photo paper. I might return it. The flash is way too strong for portraits it washes everything out. I still think it\x92s kind of fun. But not really worth what I paid.\nFour Stars. Great product\nFour Stars. Gift\nNot a good value.. Pictures are too small and not vibrant\nFour Stars. Nice product " 
 " however the camera should have more megapixels. No just 10.\nNeat idea "  " poor execution. Don\x92t buy it yet. It\x92s fun. Just not ready for mass marketing. No instructions "  " no Microcard SD "  " as stated on the box.  I am searching the internet for a manual. Pictures have been unimpressive. The information on the box is far from acceptable. I\x92m not new to using cameras "  " With 2 Minoltas "  " 4 Olympus "  " and 2 Nikon DSLR cameras "  " I am well versed in \x93photography speak? At 65 " 
 " I have 50 years of experience. I just want a means to hand out photos of family coming for the holidays. Cute idea "  " poor execution. Save your money. Note "  " if you carry the camera "  " and barely touch the shutter button "  " you will take pictures of your porch "  " your sink "  " and various items around the house. I am going to modify mine so that can\x92t happen. The idea for the camera is ingenious. Some one should send me a manual and a10 -pack of film for my learning curve. Plue a detailed manual. USA made? You can\x92t spell either. I want this camera to catch-on. Kodak has a potential with this camera. It\x92s cool.\nand also a process of creating can be less long but the whole view is just perfect " 
 " together with the affordable price. That is basically your one stop shooting center right in your hand. Well the spectra of the evaluable colors can be a little more variable "  " and also a process of creating can be less long but the whole view is just perfect "  " together with the affordable price.\nCamera Basic "  " pictures suck. Not very happy.  When I heard Kodak had finally released a new automatic camera - I couldn't wait "  " then when I got the camera "  " I was so disappointed! Looking over the camera -well if I'd seen it in  a store I WOULD NOT have bot this camera.  first 3 photos sucked " 
 " 2 of the cat - one needed flash "  " other didn't.  One self photo that was OK.  Thing to decide if I wan to send it back "  " but there are a few times over the holidays it can be useful\nGreat Except for Shutter Release Button. In my opinion the image quality is better than indicated by any of the reviews I read on this camera.  If you take a shot in decent lighting prints are totally acceptable for a VERY basic "  " no frills camera.  Also you need a little distance (maybe 4-6 feet) between the camera and the subject.  Otherwise " 
 " faces are blown out.  I've only had the flash fire once and that was in very low light and the image was horrible.  It's just a fun little camera and not meant to produce art.  I love the way you can peel off the backing and stick the picture in journals "  " on letters "  " in albums "  " etc.  I also love that images are saved to a micro SD card.  (Not included with camera "  " but very cheap to buy these days.)  What I do NOT like about the camera is the shutter release button is EXTREMELY easy to accidentally press.  Each time you do that you can kiss 50 cents goodbye.  Couldn't they make it so it requires at least SOME pressure to depress?  All in all " 
 " though "  " great fun.\nThe most disappointing gift ever.. My son received this as a gift this year. Seemed easy enough for a teenager to use as it\x92s sturdy and pretty straightforward but it\x92s a terrible camera! The viewfinder & actual print don\x92t line up at all. The quality of the print is majorly lacking - blurry "  " discolored "  " and very much an expensive Zink paper gamble. Out of a 10-pack "  " only one print comes out that\x92s not godawful! I do think ours might be defective as I\x92ve owned many cameras and the viewfinder issue with this isn\x92t mentioned in any other review so I think might be just our problem? Not that it matters because it was a gift and I can\x92t return it without the Amazon return info. I\x92ll be continuing to contact customer service on replacing or refunding it. I do not recommend this camera!\nThis is a fun " 
 " cheap camera.. This is a fun "  " cheap camera that is reminiscent of those cheap drugstore Point and Shoot throw aways.Honestly "  "  my phone made the picture come out clearer than it really is!I found the film expensive for it's quality "  "  and after not using the camera for more than 6 months "  " I wanted to try it again and I found that at first "  " the camera was not printing yet still had film in it. So "  " it needed the blue strip to be recalibrated. Okay "  " done - had to open a new pack. Then " 
 " the back did not want to close! What? No matter what I do "  " it won't close "  " and the plastic is cheap and thin enough to break if you apply too much force.Do not buy unless you use this as a toy or fun project to play with.  Even with the picture printing out as stickers "  " there are other means to accomplish this.\nKodak disappoints.. I really wanted to absolutely love it!Image quality is to be expected for the price. There is a learning curve also.Here's why I couldn't give it a better rating.1. The power button is so easily pressed you can not even put it in your pocket/purse. Even on the seat in the car you have to worry about accidentally turning it on.2. The shutter button is also too easy to click. Wasted quite a few this way also.3. Battery life pretty much only lasts one pack of paper. 10 images.4. Slow shutter response. If you forget to wait a couple seconds after the beep " 
 " you might end up with a blurry picture of your feet.Most of the cool stuff is the same as the rest of the modern instant cameras.\nWorked ONE day and won't charge - AVOID. If KODAK Customer Service will respond in a timely manner "  " I may update the 1-star. But this camera worked a single day (my daughter's birthday) then won't charge. Light just stays red. View finder won't come on. Tried a million outlets. My wife emailed Customer Service and we're essentially in line.There is clearly a battery defect (quality control issue) on at least certain percentage of these cameras as noted in some of the other reviews. Wished we had listened but figured it was just a freak issue with some folks. Nope. Got us too.Waiting for KODAK to make this right. Super bummed daughter right now also waiting. She's been wanting a camera for forever. She had an awesome time with it while it worked " 
 " but again "  " that was only a single day. She was also really careful with it so no drops "  " no shaking. Nothing she did on her end to cause the issue.There's a simple solution KODAK: we bought your camera. Bought the pricey paper separately. Product is defective. Send a replacement at no cost. I'll cross my fingers it works. Happy to send back this one if you pay for shipping.This is the only bad review I've ever left on Amazon. My son even wanted one (when my daughter's worked) and that is for sure not happening.If you're reading this " 
 " you may get lucky and get a non-defective version of this. That's what I thought too. But I would suggest you consider a different brand.\nJust amazing. I love it. Those are my provesI really like it "  " comes with 3 different effects but I only like one ( the colorful one)Mostly it\x92s going to depend on the LightroomIf you are in a place that does not have enough light is not going to be as colorful as desired. If you take a picture really far away "  " it\x92s not going to work either. But I love my camera " 
 " it\x92s awesome is super fast to print "  " you can make a collage pressing the button three seconds and you can also stick the pic on a surfaceOh and there\x92s one filter that looks as the camera doesn\x92t work "  " like fainted but it\x92s the filter ( I got confused too)There\x92s a blue paper that comes with the paper to adjust the colors "  " after it comes of naturally you can throw it\nKodak Printomatic and Fuji Instax 11 comparison and reviews. This review explains pros and cons and the Kodak Printomatic and the Fuji Instax 11 cameras. Sample photographs provided!Kodak PrintomaticThe Kodak Printomatic camera is a fun way to share physical photographs. Pictures are printed as stickers using Zink inkless film. The image quality isn\x92t great " 
 " but the point of this camera isn\x92t serious photography "  " just fun and creative memories.SPECIAL NOTE: other brands of Zink paper DO WORK in the Kodak camera (such as Polaroid)-- if using another brand "  " replace the blue calibration card with a used Kodak blue calibration card. Kodak Zink seems to generate better-looking photos.Pros:Rechargeable batteryColor and B&W optionsPictures save to micro SD cardEasily fits into a pocketCons:Flash is automatic with no On/Off settingNo way to see how many Zink sheets are remaining in the cameraVery easy to accidentally take a picture (the shutter button is not guarded against mishaps)Makes a loud beep when taking picturesBlack and white photos have a slight pink tinge to one sideFuji Instax 11The Kodak Printomatic camera is a fun way to share physical photographs. Pictures develop like the now-retro Polaroid prints " 
 " though rectangular instead of square. The image quality isn\x92t great "  " but the point of this camera isn\x92t serious photography "  " just fun and creative memories.SPECIAL NOTE: The Flash-- Images provided show with a flash and \x93without?(flash was covered).Pros:Super cute retro designWindow for film remaining (count)Tiny mirror on lens (which is ingenious) for taking selfies!Attachments available for lens and flash for changing the image color or special effect (sold separately or in the bundle option)Cons:Flash is automatic with no On/Off setting. Outside pictures generally do not need a flash- covering the flash often makes a better quality picture when ample natural light is presentSlightly awkward as the camera is taller than wide (less standard)Slightly bulky compared to the Kodak Printomatic " 
 " though not a huge problem (won\x92t fit easily into a pocket)\nDont Buy. Terrible quality pictures. Blurry "  " super dark "  " and orange pictures every single time. No real manual or instructions to speak of. No power cord included. No SD card included. No working flash to make the blurry photos less orange. This thing is actually useless and your better off buying a 10 year old camera. Don't waste your money. I would give this negative stars if possible. It shouldn't even be sold.\nNot even an adult can fix. The media could not be loaded. " 
 "                 "  "             "  "                 "  "             "  "             "  "         "  "     "  "     "  "  \xa0By far the worst product ever purchased on Amazon. It was for my 5 year old niece who loves to take pictures. The camera was supposed to be charged with no charger cable provided. Finally got a charger and turned the camera on wouldn\x92t take pictures. Then reset through the little pinhole using a thick pin and thought finally it\x92ll work! Nope! Paper took forever to come out and then came out blank!!! Tried turning paper and same thing! Even used the blue paper like it said first. Nothing worked! Worst camera ever!\nTerrible quality and terrible usability.. Just got this as a Christmas gift. First " 
 " every picture has a terrible orange tint "  " also "  " once you load with the full pack of paper the cover doesn\x92t close completely "  " won\x92t close completely and now we\x92ve completely shot the cover and the spring so it constantly falls off and exposes the rest of the paper. Once you load it with all the paper "  " it also jams repeatedly leaving you to empty half the paper back out (mind you "  " this is only ten sheets and they run about $1 a sheet) and overexpose more of the paper. We are only day three of owning this camera and immensely frustrated.  Kodak " 
 " do better!\nDO NOT BUY.. I bought two of these for my 5 and 8 year olds. One of them broke before 2 days worth of use. The springs shot out and while I was able to get it back together "  " it now falls apart every time you add more film. The photo quality is seeeeriously awful. My expectations weren\x92t especially high - I was purchasing this for kids after all "  " but this next level bad. Every single pic is blurry and tinted red. Also "  " when you push the button to take a pic "  " it beeps?so you think you took the picture and then after a pause it beeps again and actually takes the picture now that you\x92ve put the camera down. We will definitely be trashing these and getting a regular old Polaroid. The only good thing I can say is that the sticker concept is cool " 
 " but the pics are so bad we don\x92t have any desire to stick them anywhere.\nNo screen? We're back to the dark ages here.. So "  " my biggest problem with this camera is not that it comes with ZERO paper to print your pictures despite the $70 price tag (even though that's true "  " much to the chagrin of my child who got this for Christmas and can't play with it until we go to the store and buy paper) "  " but the fact that there is no screen on it.  Look through your parents' photo album.  It's full of terrible pictures " 
 " b/c you took one picture and you got what you got.  This camera would be MUCH improved if there was a screen that allowed you to review your pictures and only print what you like.I assume Kodak wants to milk on extra purchase of the paper "  " but in the end "  " we're just going to get tired of having print outs of bad pictures "  " and eventually just stop using the camera.\nGood camera-doesn\x92t come with charger. Great little camera! Bought it for a friend for her birthday and she loves it. Good color choices and takes nice little pictures! Prints a little slow so there\x92s down time between each shot but they come out nice. Note the camera does not run on batteries it\x92s a rechargeable camera with a micro USB and doesn\x92t come with a charger so make sure you have one on hand!\nTHE POSITIVE REVIEWS ON THIS PRODUCT ARE BOTS. CLICK ON THE USER NAMES of any of the weirdly robotic 5 star reviews even though they say  verified purchaserWhat are the odds that every single one is a brand new user with a single purchase review to their account ..... This one.Suspicious.\nNEED HELP FOR THE POLAROID  " 
 ". i  loved the camera i have the kodak  "  " the polaroid  "  " if the polaroid would have not just STOP printing it is GREAT but now won't PRINT but the different is the Polaroid  gives you so many options until i fell in love with it took it on one of my cruses BIG fun then it just stopped and thinking it waspaper i spent so much and no one can tell me what the PROBLEM is ... so as far as stars i would give polaroid 5 stars 4 stars for oh and it is called Polaroid snap touch!!!!! help!\nDon\x92t waste your money.. This camera was totally worthless.  All of the pictures were orange " 
 " most of them blurry even when you try to hold it really still.  These photos were taken in a room with a lot of light "  " we even tried to take one in low light to see if the flash worked but it never flashed.  I contacted customer service and they said that is just how it is.  I returned this camera and got a Fuji instant print and it is WAY better!  The pictures from this camera  were so bad "  " most of the time you couldn\x92t even tell what the picture was. I included a picture from the new camera for comparison. Taken in the same room as the others with the same light.  If I could give it negative stars I would!\nsuper unreliable. i\x92ve gave this camera multiple chances " 
 " at my homecoming and even prom and graduation "  " every single time it worked for a good two photos and then it wouldn\x92t print "  " or it would print black and blurry pictures "  " it\x92s very cute but i wouldn\x92t recommend.\nBroken!. I was using my camera I clicked the button to make it printAnd it made a beep noise and did not get anything out!And the light started flashing I tried printing againAnd it beeped.Before that it was working fine and the pictures haveRed and orange in them. Also they are very blurry.  DO NOT BUY THIS\nWorks as Designed " 
 " Middling Photo Quality. Camera works as expected "  " and is a cool novelty.Do not expect it to blow you away with inage quality. It\x92s a low end 10 MP sensor "  " with really poor low light performance. Images during the day come out decently but darker environments are grainy. Real chemical process instant cameras provide better quality at a much higher price per photo.Overall understand the limitations with this camera "  " and you will be happy. It excels at quick snapshots in well lit areas.\nIt has no options and is difficult to figure out. I got this camera with bank points " 
 " so I sorta got it for 'free'. That being said "  " if I had paid money for it "  " I'd be really let down.This camera is so simple it's insulting. It's so simple it's nondescript and a total mystery at times. The instruction manual does not say anything about what the beeps mean when a picture is taken "  " when a picture is considered 'taken' "  " and how long after taking the picture will the picture will print.Nor does it specify the conditions under which the flash will go off. The flash is very bright " 
 " and it can completely white-wash photos that aren't in the best light. It's basically unpredictable as to whether or not it will go off "  " so make sure you give it ample light so as not to ruin the photo (and every wasted photo is about $0.50 to $1.00 down the drain).\nNo Charger Included. The camera is nice and ideal for my 4th grade students use to take pictures to go with writing. The quality is what you\x92d expresar from a $70 printing camera. However "  " mine did not come with a charger! That\x92s my biggest disappointment. Is there a way to get a charger sent out to me?I got this camera from Amazon via Donor\x92s Choose!\nDisappointing quality and durability. Received it as a gift for my 5yo. Very low quality that compares to first cell phone cameras about dozen years ago.Broke after about 20 photos - stopped grabbing paper " 
 " even with new pack "  " after powercycle and recharging.When it did work - only one out of 3 photos on average would be as expected - one would randomly come out when turning on the camera "  " one would come out because the shutter button is too sensitive "  " and only one would come out as expected\nHorrible quality!. Picture quality was horrible! Out of 30 shots 3 of them were kind of okay and were taken outdoors.  You cannot use this camera indoors. Also "  " the snapshot button is very sensitive so with a slight touch it will snap a photo. These were a return. Not worth the money at all!\nUPDATE | IT'S STOP PRINTING IN GOOD QUALITY. This was a gift present for my girl. She loves it. the color of the camera is just like her spice yellowOn the first day we took about 20 photos. The photo quality is very unique is have like gray color of similar to a filter.another thing that would like that very much is was that a photo print is dustproof waterproof. It's easy to find over Amazon or other stores. The print time it's about like ~50 seconds first with the calibration paper.\nToo sensitive shutter button. My 7 years old girl loves it. Photo quality isn\x92t great but i kinda like that. Love that old look.Only and the biggest problem is the shutter button is ridiculously sensitive. there is no way to stop printing it as far as I know.Plus " 
 " you can keep accidentally push the button while camera is printing. So you will easily waste a few papers.I feel the manufacture intentionally design like that so that people waste more papers.So -1 star.\nTerrible. This is the worst camera. I loved the idea of it and was really excited. It takes horrible picture and has horrible color contrast in the photos.\nJunk. Remember your decade old digital camera? Yea its worst quality than that. Oh an it doesn't come with an SD card or charging cord to make it even more useless.\nPLEASE Don't Waste Your Money.. Shown is a photo the camera took day one. I don't have any more because the camera has stopped working. You can see the quality of the photo. Definitely returning the camera and extra film. Waste of money.\nNo charging cable? seriously. Kiddo got this as a Christmas gift. Its an ok camera for an 8 year old but it didnt come with a charging cable.... Seriously this is 2021 about to be 2022 and you skimp on a charging cable. As for the print quality it has the feel of a 80's camera it comes out a little fuzzy on edges of items and if you have something with a contrast of vibrant colors good luck everything comes out blurry. I wouldnt recommend this to anyone save your money and get a disposable.\nNot worth it. This was gifted to my daughter by her grandmother. Pictures come out red an blurry. We had it replaced once and it still prints the same. We've followed directions to a T and still comes out that way.\nDid we like it??? Absolutely not.. This product was honestly a hunk of junk. Never write negative reviews unless it\x92s really bad. Picture quality is TERRIBLE. Ink cartridges don\x92t last long at all. Battery dies VERY quickly. You don\x92t even get the choice to print a picture. It automatically takes one and prints once that button is touched. Too much money wasted on ordering so many paper refills. Ours lasted all of an hour and we were already having regrets with this purchase. I would strongly recommend steering away from this one.\n$. Great " 
 " very handy "  " its small and I take it everywhere I go "  " so that I can capture anything that goes on!\nNo charging cable included.. Will not come with charger. Which is dumb!Got the camera as a gift for my kids and didn't know it needs a charger and does not include it either.Killed the excitement.\nTerrible pictures. The pictures are terrible "  " even in well lit areas. They are pinkish and blurry. A complete disappointment for a Christmas gift. Spend the money on a Polaroid.\nJammed after second use. Paper started jamming after the second use. The camera worked fine at first but I\x92m sad I only got to use it once. It was gift " 
 " my sisters got for me before traveling. Now I know not to buy Kodak cameras.\nDON\x92T BUY IT. As someone who also owns a Fujifilm Instax mini and had something to compare it to DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT and instead buy a Fujifilm Instax mini. The photo quality of this product was horrible and every picture turned out orange. The pictures did not meet my expectations of what they showed as examples. I returned it. ALSO IT DOESN\x92T COME WITH A CHARGER WHICH I THOUGHT WAS STUPID\nDysfunctional Product. Yikes. After one use " 
 " the camera completely stopped functioning. Terrible product "  " steer clear. I am extremely disappointed that I did not receive a response from the seller either. Entirely dysfunctional and dishonest product. Does not work.\nWorst purchase!. It doesn\x92t work! Took 3 photos and that was it. It jams and beeps and there is no help from troubleshooting documents on the Kodak website. Don\x92t wast your money!\nPoor Picture Quality. This camera feels flimsy and not durable. The picture quality is horrible and I\x92m notExaggerating this. Not compatible on any level to a Polaroid or Fuji. It\x92s not even toy quality. I\x92d personally go with something else or just use your phone camera and separate printer. Too bad instant cameras are cool. But this one is a fail.\nMemories everywhere. I purchased this as an easy to use and portable way to capture memories in random moments of life. I really enjoy taking it with me in my car and taking it out for those slice of life moments with friends. To have something tangible to remember an event or activity is something I greatly appreciate and this item is a fun gift for myself that I wanted and enjoyed!\nDon\x92t order aqua camera - NO charging cord and not as promised. Don\x92t purchase the aqua colored Kodak Printomatic camera. It doesn\x92t come with a charging cord (I ordered 2 thinking 2nd one would have cord. The pink one came with a charging cord and it appears to be an updated model which was advertised for both!  The pink one has a black/white option and more pixels too!  They were ordered from the same Amazon page\nDon't waste your money. This camera is terrible. It's incredibly picky on lighting and with as expensive as the 'film' is " 
 " its not worth it. I got this as a christmas present and I should have asked for a FujiFilm or actual Polaroid "  " because this is trash.\nDon't Just Don't. Don't do it I got it for my 9yr old son. He wanted sticker camera afrer 4 dark picture's.. It's useless very cheap product for price . I'd hoped for better now stuck with a non working camera! In it took very dark photos\nAwful print quality. Awful print quality! The design is nice and the camera itself is durable but the prints are just horrible.\nWaste of money. This product is a waste of money. First " 
 " there is no charger or charger cord so couldn't use it on Christmas. The camera doesn't operate properly "  " the zinc paper doesn't print and no pictures! Don't waste your money!!!\nSuper easy. Fun\nYou should buy it. Omg so cute! I love this lil camera and recommend it.\ndurable device. What I like most about my new printomatic that my dad got me for my birthday "  " thanks daddy "  " is that I can take it anywhere. Fits right in the back pocket of my jeans or in my purse "  " a perfectly portable device. Also " 
 " I had it out the other day when it started pouring rain and the camera was fine "  " so you can use it in bad weather too! So durable!\nCharger missing. Hello "  " we are missing the charger. How do we get that? Thank you.\nThe Print Quality is HORRIBLE.. Literally "  " do yourself a favor and DO NOT BUY THIS. The camera is cute and appealing "  " and it gives off the idea that it would be good "  " but the picture quality is so horrible you can hardly even make out what it is that you JUST took a picture of. I never write reviews... this was that horrible that I had to write one. You will be so disappointed.\nJust don\x92t.... Awful. The pictures came out red and blurry. I don\x92t understand how this has any great reviews.\nNo good.. All the bad reviews are accurate. I wish I would have read them before buying <U+0001F616>\nDeplorable quality. This broke within months of regular use. The quality of the image is horrendous. It's a cheap imitation of a Polaroid\nDurability <U+0001F44E> \x97\xa0don't buy for a kid. This camera lasted a whole 3 hours.  One drop and it's completely broken.\nJunkie. Junkie\nGood bargain. If you find an instant print camera that's easier to use " 
 " let me know because this one is so simple it's ridiculous. Shoot and print "  " it does all the work "  " all you have to do is press a button and you have a beautiful photograph in your hands. Good bargain.\nNo compren de segunda!.. Todas las fotos salen mal! No compren nada de segunda!.\n. Todas las fotos salen mal! No compren nada de segunda!.\nLOVE This Camara!. I love this camara. Arrived just in time for my daughters baby shower. Takes great pictures. Love that it has a sd card slot as well. Just as described by seller. Thank you!\nYou have to be sooooo still. There isn\x92t any way to control the flash " 
 " you never know how many pictures you have left "  " and every picture I have taken is so blurry "  " too dark "  " or way to bright.\nRed tint poor quality.. Very disappointed at the print and image quality. Images are blurred with a red tint.\nFun for quarantine. This instant print camera is a joy to have and easy to use. Has really brightened up my quarantine. Been spending hours trying out new ways to take photos and make collages with it "  " having a great time.\nThis was a waste of money.. No mention was made that a certain size of charging cord is necessary but not included.  The camera failed to print after only a few uses.  The paper is expensive.  The size of the prints " 
 " although clearly stated "  " is disappointing.\nAll my pictures are turning out orange. The photo quality is horrible. All of the pictures are orange. I\x92ve tried to fix it and I can\x92t figure it out. I\x92ll be unfortunately returning.\nQuality is okay. With the price that the product comes in for "  " the quality is not that great. I would have loved better quality photos\nVery nice!. I love this camera!\nNot a good product. This was a gift for a granddaughter. 10 yr old. It does not work correctly. Jams pictures and now 3 months later I cant return it. Not a good buy.\nShort on film but great camera for the price!. I purchased the blue one " 
 " and was happily surprised when it arrived early! My only disappointment was when my pack of film that came with the camera only contained 5 sheets instead of 10. But I have more film coming "  " and I'm excited to use it some more!!\nNo light indicators on my camera. Can someone let me know why my Kodak printomatic does not come with any of the light indicators or the black and white features?\nTruly instant. Printing so fast you can truly call it instant "  " prints photos in just a few seconds. High defintion photos with stunning colors make me want to take more and more.\nThis doesn\x92t work and is a waste of money. It will not charge or print.. This will not charge or print. Huge waste of money.\nMissing charger. I sent this to my granddaughter for her birthday.  I just found out from my son that there was no charger included.  Help??\nJust meh at best. So " 
 " as with others "  " I love the design of this camera! It\x92s a sleek looking piece of technology. The issue for me is that when I received the package "  " it said it was 5mp "  " but was advertised as 10mp. I\x92m not sure what this is all about "  " but returned it "  " simply because the quality is average. Go with Instax. So much cleaner "  " and the images are amazing.\nMissing Power Cord. The camera works well "  " but only because we found a power cord that worked to charge it.  Unfortunately " 
 " the power cord that the box says it includes was not found with the camera.\nPoor picture quality. Don't waste your money. Picture quality is poor.\nPoor picture quality. I didn't expect awesome pictures "  " but the picture quality is very poor.\nHorrible. Takes awful pictures "  " my nine year old does not want my present:(\n50/50. Pictures are cheap "  " so that\x92s a plus but they don\x92t come out too good. It\x92s a very cheap feeling camera that is way to sensitive on the shutter. No control of the flash so it\x92s 50/50 if it\x92s going to be too dark. I\x92ll probably give this to my sister or something. I included a picture to show how many times I had to try to get a picture of my hubby and baby. Third times the charm I guess. Only reason it go three stars is because I can\x92t do 2.5.\ndOES NOT WORK RIGHT. INSTRUCTIONS IN CAMERA are in a strange lang. maybe Chinese.\nI always loved Kodak as a camera making machine. I always loved Kodak as a camera making machine " 
 " I mean they started to create this a long time ago and almost all of them were great. And this particular camera wasn\x92t an exception. But for some reason I can\x92t find something less yellow "  " as I prefer black and dark or something like that. And that is practically it. Good choice and fantastic buy over.\nDon\x92t buy this camera. Every picture came out orange. I would never recommend this camera. Wish I could return but my husband got rid of the box.\nOver a month late delivery; blurry pictures. You have to be extremely still if you want a clear picture. Even then " 
 " it\x92s blurry.\nPoor Quality Photos. I\x92m not sure where all the 5-star reviews are coming from. The camera is easy to use and looks cool "  " but the photo quality is poor like that of a flip phone and the colors are distorted.\nNot good. Not good\nOverpriced for unreliable product. Very disappointed. Not worth the money. It hardly came with directions "  " you apparently have to stand 6ft away for picture to come out. First picture I took came out so blurry I couldn't even tell what it was. Very cheap feeling. Film is overpriced.\nCame without charging cord (which claim to be included). Came without the charging cord. We couldn\x92t even use when he unboxed. He was so disappointed.\nGreat camera " 
 " bought it for my business to make little art license. It is an awesome little camera. Just make sure you stay still until after it clicks and also use a well-lit room. I love it.\nNot kid user friendly. Not user friendly "  " picture quality not very good\nDisappointed. Photo quality is terrible refills are also expensive\nA mess free printing process. Thank goodness I no longer need to deal with cartridges because that used to be such a huge pain for me. Instant printing\xa0has never been such a clean process. Also " 
 " the shots that it prints are quite stunning. I definitely didn't expect them to be that good.\nThe prints are really clear. The photos that get printed come out in really nice quality. I didn't expect it to be this good considering the fact that it's an instant camera. I think that since it doesn't print with cartridges and instead with special photo paper "  " it comes out clearer.\nSuch a compact and fun device to have. I just love that I can print from anywhere. It's so light and small so it's no issue having it on you. It's so much fun to take to events! On top of that " 
 " the photos that come out are so nice. It's much more than what you'd expect from an instant print.\nDoesn\x92t come with charger as stated "  " make sure you open the package and check.. Doesn\x92t come with the charging cable as stated.\nHelps you take amazing photos. I love this little yellow instant camera. I think this camera makes taking a photo the easiest process that it's ever been. On top of that "  " it allows you to actually take pretty decent photos "  " instead of ones that are too blury or underdeveloped.\nAwesome!. Bought as a gift. It was amazing.\nOne of the best camera in my opinion. This point and shoot is honestly one of the best cameras in my opinion because not only does it take great shots but it also takes really solid prints " 
 " too!\nYou can take great shots and then print them out just as nicely as well. I love that I can take really nice shots and then print them out immediately getting great prints out of the shots as well. Definitely recommend this for avid photographers.\nYour instant prints won't get messed up!. I'm so happy that the photos come out smudge proof. I love printing the photos right away "  " but I'm so happy that I don't have to worry about them getting messed up.\nFunctions well and looks great. This camera is so cute. However " 
 " apart from its look "  " it delivers well "  " too! The quality is amazing and it's so convenient to be able to print whenever you want.\nGreat photos. I really like the size and how convenient it is. It's so adorable and honestly "  " I haven't taken one bad picture yet. Just make sure you don't take shots too up close and you'll be golden!\nNo ink "  " no hassle!. I no longer have the hassle of ink so I don't need film anymore! Additionally "  " photo paper prints amazing photos. They turn out so close in color to real life.\nAWFUL picture quality. Not even remotely worth it. For about the same price you can get 100% better instant photos.\nInstant print is a nice " 
 " added bonus. This is such an easy point and shoot to use and the fact that I can print the photo that I had just taken\xa0right away is such a great added bonus.\nVERY FAST SHIPPING. OMG only 4 DAYS to Thailand. Awesome !!!\n.. Description said it came with paper and it sure did not.\nOk for price. Bought it and ok for price\nMissing part and terrible quality. First of all "  " the camera came without the charging cable that was supposed to have been included in the box. This alone would have caused me to send the item back without trying it " 
 " until I realized the Kindle charger cable also fits the camera. So I thought I'd give it a shot.In hindsight "  " I wish I had returned the item as soon as possible. This camera produces horrible pictures. I wanted to like the camera. The concept is neat and the camera looks good and durable "  " but the photos that come out of it are terrible. It has zero ability to produce a recognizable picture indoors or in any light other than full daylight. I previously purchased a Fujfilm Instax Polaroid and had hoped this would provide better picture quality. But this item makes the Instax photo quality look professional compared to these (which says a lot " 
 " since Instax Polaroids themselves don't produce great pictures).\nSLOW SHUTTER SPEED. I WANTED TO TAKE FAMILY PICS WITH THIS BUT DISCOVERED THAT IF ANYONE MOVED  "  " THE PICS WOULD BE BLURRED. THIS HAS A 1/25TH OF A SECOND SHUTTER SPEED. MEANING IT PICKS UP MOVEMENT AND BLURS THE PICTURE. I GAVE THIS A 3STAR FOR THIS VERY REASON. IT HAS GREAT COLOR PICS  "  " THAT CAN COME OUT SHARP "  " PROVIDED YOU DON'T MOVE.. SO THIS IS A NICE CAMERA AS LONG AS YOUR SUBJECT SITS OR STANDS STILL. THIS  WOULD BE A CAMERA FOR KIDS " 
 " NOT REALLY FOR ADULTS.. I MEAN I GET CLEARER PICS ON MY CELL PHONE THAT ARE BETTER THAN THIS "  " PLUS MY PICS ARE 4X6  "  " NOT BUSINESS CARD SIZE. THOUGHT IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE BUT NOT FOR ME..\nAdventure Date Book Challenge. Got this camera to go with the adventure challenge book. Pictures are similar in quality and clarity similar to my great grandfathers antique Polaroid.The pictures are ok quality but that makes the nostalgia factor higher.With respect to the camera "  " the viewfinder doesn\x92t seem to match up with what image prints. The image is off a few degrees lower so if someone else uses the camera our foreheads may be shaved off.Lastly you can\x92t control the flash. It would be nice if you could control it.\nCheese. Very cool camera. Alot people complain about the printed quality " 
 " but they realize its the same quality as its always been. I love it. Brings me back\nCouldn't Get to Work. I was never able to get this to work. It would jam / bend the photo sheets. The instructions on the included photo sheets are misleading and appear to tell you to put the photo sheets in upside down. Watch a few youtube videos to know how to actually work it. A great price and sleek design... if you can get it to work. I might have just had a bad one. Returned for a refund with 10 unused (but bent) photo sheets. I might buy a new one eventually.\nPoor quality pictures. No charger or sd card.. I am very pleased with how fast the camera arrived. I\x92m not sure if it was supposed to come with a charger or not " 
 " but it didn\x92t. I\x92m just glad my parents have flip phones and the charger fits my camera! I haven\x92t taken a picture with it yet so I can\x92t say anything in that area "  " but I do know it didn\x92t come with a micro sd card either. Or a wrist strap. Just the camera and some picture paper.Update: I\x92ve taken three pictures with it now and am really disappointed with the quality of pictures it takes. It\x92s not horribly bad "  " but the faces are blurry and the lighting isn\x92t the greatest. It works though and I\x92m still pretty happy with it.\nGreat gift. I gave it to my Mother for Mother's Day and it was a hit! The only thing Mom complained about was the fact that the pics were small but once we used it she was very comfortable with the pics it printed out and the fact that the pics are also stickers is a new concept and we still have not come up with a cool plan to use them but I am sure we will soon.\nNot recommended.. no LCD preview. It is hard to keep your hand still since you don't know when the camera captures the image. I fairly good at taking photos " 
 " but I had a hard time getting a good picture out of this camera. Not recommend to anyone.\nDONT WASTE YOUR MONEY. I was so "  " so "  " so hopeful for this purchase. I wasn\x92t looking for great quality by any means "  " but these pictures turn out TERRIBLY. I was hoping that they\x92d look better on the memory card "  " but nope. I\x92m so sad because I thought I found a \x93digital?camera that acted like a disposable one. I guess the search continues\nThe pink one. A pink one for my daughter please! She just turned 12 and she's already taking some photography classes at the local community college " 
 " who would have thought she would grow up to be such a little genius "  " she certainly doesn't get it from her father's side. she loves the camera and spends all day with it "  " I have a hard time prying it out of her little hands!\nTerrible. Highly disappointed. Got two of these. For my daughter and niece. Wouldn\x92t hold a charge and got jammed on the 3rd picture we tried to print. THEN DIED AGAIN. Daughter and niece were very sad ruined their Christmas gift.\nDon\x92t do it.. The picture quality is awful. This is supposed to be a picture of a crocheted hat. I tried with the lights off so the flash would help make it more clear. I don\x92t understand.I did however " 
 " pull it out of the box and there was no charger. It was the week before Christmas and they were out of stock. I got a refund. That is a relief.\nGood bit of fun. As a photographer with a lot of professional work "  " sometimes I like to take a load off and just have fun with a camera. The kodak printomatic is a great camera to just fool around and have some fun with. No need to take your photography so seriously "  " you can just try it out and see what works. A good bit of fun.\nNot quite like a Polaroid. Not the best picture quality or photo quality but has a vintage feel and I enjoy using it\nWorth the money!. Such a fun little camera! Going to use it for my wedding for guests!!\nExciting. Got these for my two schoolteacher nieces " 
 " for fun projects in their classrooms. Expect them to have lots of fun with them.\nHorrible junk. Absolutely horrible picture quality. Do not waste your money! Get a Polaroid snap instead!\ntrip to spain. I'm taking a trip to spain with my fam next month and I wanted to take along a portable camera that doesn't cost too much. This printomatic was just what I needed. It's easy to carry "  " fits right in my little pocket "  " even the front pocket. Can't wait to take pics of those old spanish cathedrals and eat gelato by the seaside.\nDon\x92t buy waste of money. Horrible product. Photos come out awful and it\x92s hard to use and DIDNT even come with a usb cord\nA great alternative to traditional polaroids!. I bought this used " 
 " so the price was cut in half from original sale and it came in an untampered box with original packaging! Comes with 10 photo sheets to load in. You need your own microsd if you want to also save pictures that way. Best quality pictures are in bright lighting.\nGreat!. I wanted to print out all of my pictures and have photo albums for the future! This works perfect!\nNot as described. I received the camera but it\x92s nothing like the description states. It doesn\x92t have a \x93color mode?option so I can switch to black and white pictures. The camera also didn\x92t come with a charging cable. I requested for a replacement but I received the same thing.\nNot great. Keep looking!. Takes decent pictures but they aren't printed very well. Soooo blurry it's unreal!\nAlmost great. Loved it " 
 " except it didn\x92t come with a charging cable.\nDaughter's first camera. I wanted to get my daughter her first camera. I was thinking of a simple shoot and print model and came across this instant print camera. When I gave it to her she was overjoyed. She ran outside and started taking photos of all her neighborhood friends. So nice to see her playing with other kids her age.\nInstant memories. I'm busy making instant memories with the kodak printomatic but I guess I can find the time to write a review. First of all " 
 " I love how easy it is to use "  " just point and shoot and out pops a fresh pic. Second "  " it's super convenient. Small enough to stick in any pocket and won't get ink on you thanks to zink paper.\nTotally worth it. The printomatic is a great little instant print camera and I think it's one of the best I've tried. So easy to use and print from "  " I'm so glad I bought it. I've been making little collages with it recently and I'm having a great time. worth it.\nLovely gift! 10 year old loves it!!!. Great " 
 " fun camera for 10 year old's birthday. Nice because it takes instant pics and able to upload onto computer because it has an sd card.\n2 stars. it okay but the pictures are not clear angles Rs not good. RATHER the photos on my phone\nA love for photography. This is my first instant print camera and I'm having a lot of fun with it already. Got it in the mail yesterday. Was easy to set up and before I knew it I was outside taking photos. I never knew I had such a love for photography!\nGood quality. Good handy for a good memories to cherish\nPoor photo quality. Poor photo quality but cute if you don't mind.\nGreat. Great birthday gift\nOn time. Good picture\nA gift. Recipient likes it.\nTechnologically advanced. A technologically advanced yet easy to use digital printer " 
 " I can't say enough good about it. The prints are zero ink so no mess "  " and resistant to water and heat. They look great and have lots of detail even though they're small.\nLove it. Exact match and works 100%\nThe perfect gift. I brought this camera for my daughter. It was a Christmas gift. She really loves this camera.\nCute design. The design for this camera is really cute and it's so small and light it's easy to carry around with you. Picture quality is great even in dark lighting. I like how the pictures print without a border " 
 " they look nicer like that.\n2 defective cameras. The first camera was defective "  " the film compartment area did not close "  "  the second camera the film got stuck after one picture taken and the quality of the picture was poor. The color was faded and blurry looking.\nParts missing. I bought 2 of these for Christmas presents "  " both were missing their USB cable "  " the manual states cable is included.  Luckily I had some on hand so kids could use the cameras.\nA great time. Having a great time with my new instant print camera. The f2 wide angle lens really captures whatever you're taking a picture of " 
 " and the pictures look bright and have great detail.\nNice to have at a party. A camera for all ocassions "  " you can use it anytime anywhere and you're sure to get a quality looking photography. Works best indoors and is great to have around at parties.\nAnyone could use it. I must say I'm really enjoying my new printomatic. It's a lot easier to use than most cameras "  " I think anybody could learn to take pictures with it just by picking it up.\nBad color printing. I\x92m disappointed with the quality of the images.I wondered if I can get my money back.\nSimple and fun. A simple instant camera with digital capabilities. Prints automatically and saves all photos to micro sd drive if you want to print them again or edit them later.\nYou'd be surprised. More than ever before I'm starting to love this instant print camera. When you compare it to others " 
 " it's so much faster and easier to use "  " you'd be surprised.\nAll hype no game. This camera was really all hype. Terrible picture quality "  " and I seriously should have opted for a regular Polaroid camera.\nEverything should be included. I bought 3 and was disappointed when my grandchildren couldn't use the camera on Christmas day. I bought the sd card based on reviews but there's no charger. I couldn't rate because they can't use it.  Smh.\nLove it.. I love this little camera. I purchased this for something I\x92m doing and it\x92s gonna be perfect. It picture comes out right there and it\x92s just adorable.\nNo charger!. I bought this for my niece for Christmas and it didn\x92t even come with a charger. Highly disappointed! Can\x92t judge on the product quality since we can\x92t even charge it.\nGreat looking images. Lovely design and even better looking images. Bright colors " 
 " perfect size for a scrapbook or school yearbook. Sticky back of paper makes arts and crafts easier.\nToo funny!!. 10 year old complaining that she doesn't get to shake it like a Polaroid picture!! <U+0001F926><U+200D><U+2640><U+FE0F><U+0001F926><U+200D><U+2640><U+FE0F>\nOk for price. Picture quality is so so... It is cute though.\nGreat buy. I was a bit scared to buy it but I\x92m glad I did. My sister & I love it !\nCute camera. Cute little camera "  " love that my kid can keep it in his backpack or carry case\nlove this. totally recommend. i love the product\nNo charger. 12/25/20Did not come with a charger.\nWhere is the charger... Missing.. This product did not come with a Charger. Please mail me the charger. We can't use this product. Big disappointment right on Christmas morning.\nCame broken. Back of the camera came disassembled.  All of the parts (springs " 
 " 2 other metal pieces) weren't glued and can't find instructions anywhere on how to fix it.\nWorks okay "  " but fun to use. Nice gift "  " works well enough to goof around and capture some memories\nAmazing product. Beautiful and the absolute perfect gift for loved ones\nGood camera!!. Product was just as described in happy with it!\nIt\x92s alright. It alright\nAmazon rocks. Great price\nperfect for a kid. gave this to my 10 year old brother for Christmas. He took some really cool looking pictures. Sure they might be a little blurry but not in a bad way " 
 " more in like an interesting vintage aesthetic way. He loved it. Also "  " he happened to drop it and the back exploded but luckily it was just the plastic and the spring contraption and it still works great. So its gotta be well made...\nReally frustrated. On top of being extremely disappointed with the product.  I just realized that I paid the same price for two identically listed cameras which I thought were just in two different colors "  " but one is actually a lesser model.  Total scam.  Horrible photo quality " 
 " broken photo paper door "  " lesser model than advertised "  " no power cord included "  " does not shoot in both black and white and color as the other camera I purchased under the same listing does.  Really feeling misled and taken advantage of.  No contact for seller. ")"
